Yeah, sorry it came across as a bit harsh.

Benoit did explain it to me so I understood it in the end (I think!)

So I can only speak for myself here, but I'm pretty familiar with
iSCSI, using it, and some of the internals -- in fact I'm using the
Linux kernel target daily.

Reading this several times, I now think I get what it's trying to say,
but I think it needs to introduces the terms (as the Economist style
does).  Something like this:

  "TCM is the new name for LIO, an in-kernel iSCSI target (server).
  Existing TCM targets run in the kernel.  TCMU (TCM in Userspace)
  allows userspace programs to be written which act as iSCSI targets.
  This document describes the design.

  The existing kernel provides modules for different SCSI transport
  protocols.  TCM also modularizes the data storage.  There are
  existing modules for file, block device, RAM or using another SCSI
  device as storage.  These are called "backstores" or "storage
  engines".  These built-in modules are implemented entirely as kernel
  code."

And hopefully having defined a bit of background, the rest of the
document just flows nicely:

Rich.
