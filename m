Aha, so you were worried about the same thing. Not sure we need this,
but at least I understand you and...

Yes ;)

Hmm. confused again,

Yes. But this is the point-of-no-return, de_thread() is called after the execing
thared has already passed (say) check_unsafe_exec().

However, do_execve() takes cred_guard_mutex at the start in prepare_bprm_creds()
and drops it in install_exec_creds(), so it should solve the problem?
