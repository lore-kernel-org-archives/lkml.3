So we're talking about two kinds of attacks, right?

Type 1: Unprivileged process does something like open("/proc/1/maps",
O_RDONLY) and then passes the resulting fd to something privileged.

Type 2: Unprivileged process does something like
open("/proc/self/maps", O_RDONLY) and then forks.  The parent calls
execve on something privileged.


Can we really not get away with fixing type 1 by preventing these
files from being opened in the first place and type 2 by revoking all
of these fds when a privilege-changing exec happens?

I'm not objecting to your patches so much as thinking that read(2) has
no business looking at current->cred *at all*.  But maybe that ship
has already sailed.
