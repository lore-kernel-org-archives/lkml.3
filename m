Is there a bug report for this issue?  It's nice to have a pointer to,
e.g., a bugzilla.kernel.org bug report with info such as dmesg logs,
lspci output, etc., for future reference.  Maybe somebody will figure
out a more generic change that could make this quirk unnecessary, and
details will help in figuring that out.

I assume the actual PCI discovery done in the PCI core works fine;
it's just that the driver doesn't work if MSIs are disabled on the
device.  If that's the case, can this be fixed by some driver change?
Maybe the driver needs to enable MSI before it sends commands to the
device?

Any description of what this failure looks like to a user?  How can a
user or a distro connect a symptom (driver timeout, console message,
or whatever) to this patch?
