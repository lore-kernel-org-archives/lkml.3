So the interface is wrong.  We have two semantically different kernel
states which are being communicated to userspace in the same way, so
userspace cannot disambiguate.

Solution: invent a better communication scheme with a richer payload. 
Use that, deprecate the old interface if poss.

Another solution: add a mode knob to select between alternative kernel
behaviors (yuk).

Another solution: get David to think of a solution which addresses the
issues which others have raised.

Johannes' final email in this thread has yet to be replied to, btw.
