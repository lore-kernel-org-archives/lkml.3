If we allow root to remount without "sharelock" (or bypass conflict
checks), it will definitely break the service for all users. Probably
it's better to stop the service (that cause all sharelocks to be
unlocked), fix the emergency and start the service again.

In the current state, the patchset doesn't allow any sort of ignoring
those locks for mounts with "sharelock" option (either remount without
"sharelock" or set special capabilities). It was done to make sure
nothing breaks applications relying upon sharelock behavior. Also,
that's why "sharelock" mount option was added: this behavior is
dangerous to be on critical system paths like "/" or "/lib" and not
suitable for global use.
