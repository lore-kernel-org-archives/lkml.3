This patch looks like a good start, but there's a whole lot of other
PCI-related initialization that I would suggest moving as well --
pci_request_regions(), ioremap(), pci_set_drvdata(), pci_enable_msi,
request_irq(), etc.  I would do this myself, but there are some pieces
that don't look completely trivial, e.g., things like
TW_DISABLE_INTERRUPTS() and twa_reset_sequence() don't look like
they're SCSI-specific, but they are currently implemented using
tw_dev, which looks like it's allocated by scsi_host_alloc().
Untangling all this looks like more work than I want to sign up to.

But I really don't want to put the quirk in because it's just a quick
hack that apparently just covers up bugs in the driver, and it will be
an annoyance in the PCI core forever.
