No, you're right.  Ugh.

It might pay to add an explicit .fault callback to vm_special_mapping,
but your approach will work, too.  The main downside is more memory
overhead per mm.

Hmm.  This will break the _COARSE timing functions as well as
__vdso_time.  That'll need fixing, either by swapping out the code
(yuck!) or by adding a branch to all of those code paths.

Maybe there's a non-branchy way, though.  Let me think.
