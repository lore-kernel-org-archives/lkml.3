Not sure I follow..  How does the proposed passthrough mode prevent
someone from emulating OSDs, media changers, optical disks or anything
else in userspace with TCMU..?

The main thing that the above comments highlight is why attempting to
combine the existing in-kernel emulation with a userspace backend
providing it's own emulation can open up a number of problems with
mismatched state between the two.
