I think that you are an order of magnitude off here in thinking about the scale 
of the operations.

An enabled, synchronize copy offload to an array (or one that turns into a 
reflink locally) is effectively the cost of the call itself. Let's say no slower 
than one IO to a S-ATA disk (10ms?) as a pessimistic guess. Realistically, that 
call is much faster than that worst case number.

Copying any substantial amount of data - like the target workload of VM images 
or media files - would be hundreds of MB's per copy and that would take seconds 
or minutes.

We should really work on getting the basic mechanism working and robust without 
any complications, then we can look at real, measured performance and see if 
there is any justification for adding complexity.

thanks!
