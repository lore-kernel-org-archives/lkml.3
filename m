I think that this is still confusing - reflink and array copy offload should not 
be differentiated.  In effect, they should often be the same order of magnitude 
in performance and possibly even use the same or very similar techniques (just 
on different sides of the initiator/target transaction!).

It is much simpler to let the application fail if the offload (or reflink) is 
not supported and let it do the traditional copy offload.  Then you always send 
the largest possible offload operation and do whatever you do now if that fails.

thanks!
