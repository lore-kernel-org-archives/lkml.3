SMB/CIFS servers will signal the operation "going async" by returning a
STATUS_PENDING response if the operation is not prompt, but this only
happens once. The client is still expected to run a timer, and recover from
possibly lost responses and/or unresponsive servers. Windows clients
extend their timeout when this occurs, typically quadrupling it.

Some clients will issue ECHO requests to probe the server in this
case, but it is neither a protocol requirement nor does it truly address
the issue of tracking each pending operation. Windows SMB2 clients
do not do this.
