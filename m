A agree. That's why I called using a new syscall a sledgehammer.
Still, I just wanted to remind folk who might think of something
better.

Sure, but the more we special case things, the uglier the ABI as a
whole becomes. So special casing should be avoided as far as we can.

And that's more or less how I see it too. I'm not going to argue for a
new syscall, based on what I know so far.

Here is one idea to think about though, while more or less maintaining
your proposed interface.

At the moment, you select signal queues in the pread() call. An
alternative would be to do it in the signalfd() call. In other words,
you could have the following flags used with signalfd()

SFD_RAW
SFD_SHARED_QUEUE -- reads will be from process-wide shared signal queue
SFD_PER_THREAD_QUEUE --reads will be from per-thread signal queue

Specifying both SFD_SHARED_QUEUE  and SFD_PER_THREAD_QUEUE would be
the same as omitting them both, providing the default behavior of
slecting from both queues.

My point here is that you can then separate the RAW functionality from
the queue selector functionality. Now, it might be that at the moment
you always require that if the caller specifies SFD_SHARED_QUEUE  or
SFD_PER_THREAD_QUEUE, then they must also specify SFD_RAW. But later,
that constraint might be relaxed, so that users could use signalfd()
to select from a particular queue when reading traditional (non-RAW)
signalfd_siginfo structures from a signalfd. This does seem like a
very sensible design optimization to make now (and an easy one, I
would suppose). What do you think?

Cheers,

Michael
