Certain leaks are already an issue, even without kernel base randomization.
But yeah, this would give an incentive to plug more infoleaks. I'm not
sure what cost this would incur on kernel development.

There are by-design ones (printk) and bugs. I think we would want to
correct bugs regardless?
For by-design ones, privilege-reduction can often be an appropriate answer.

I really see KASLR as the next natural step:
1. Enforce different privilege levels via the kernel
2. Attackers attack the kernel directly
3a. Allow user-land to restrict the kernel's attack surface and
develop sandboxes (seccomp-bpf, kvm..)
3b. Add more exploitation defenses to the kernel, leveraging (3a) and (1).

It would certainly be nice to have more, but it's a good first start.
Unlike user-land segfaults, many kernel-mode panics aren't recoverable
for an attacker.
