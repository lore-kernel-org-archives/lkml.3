Changing C/MTIME on the inode. Needs a lock, the update is
transactional.

And allocation during writeback is holding the lock on that inode
as it's already in a transaction.

Because we made all metadata updates in XFS fully transactional in
3.4:

commit 8a9c9980f24f6d86e0ec0150ed35fba45d0c9f88
Author: Christoph Hellwig <hch@infradead.org>
Date:   Wed Feb 29 09:53:52 2012 +0000

    xfs: log timestamp updates
    
    Timestamps on regular files are the last metadata that XFS does not update
    transactionally.  Now that we use the delaylog mode exclusively and made
    the log scode scale extremly well there is no need to bypass that code for
    timestamp updates.  Logging all updates allows to drop a lot of code, and
    will allow for further performance improvements later on.
    
    Note that this patch drops optimized handling of fdatasync - it will be
    added back in a separate commit.

IOWs, you're just lucky you haven't noticed it on 3.4....

> Are there any suggestions for how to eliminate them?

Nope. You're stuck with it - there's far more places in the page
fault path where you can get stuck on the same lock for the same
reason - e.g. during block mapping for the newly added pagecache
page...

Hint: mmap() does not provide -deterministic- low latency access to
mapped pages - it is only "mostly low latency". mmap() has exactly
the same worst case page fault latencies as the equivalent write()
syscall. e.g., dirty too many pages and mmap() write page faults
can be throttled, just like a write() syscall....

Cheers,

Dave.
