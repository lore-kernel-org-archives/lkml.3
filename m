Just to be clear... we're going with Andreas' fix, wherein

time->tv_sec |= (__u64)(le32_to_cpu(extra) & EXT4_EPOCH_MASK) << 32;

becomes:

time->tv_sec += (__u64)(le32_to_cpu(extra) & EXT4_EPOCH_MASK) << 32;

"or" becomes "plus"?  So I can update fuse2fs.

Also, can someone proofread [1] and make sure it's correct?
