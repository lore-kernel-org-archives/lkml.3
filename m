I think that, if we really want to support clean fexecve on O_CLOEXEC
scripts some day, the right way to do it is to fix the script
interface for real.  Have a special flag in the headers of script
interpreters that support a new interface that says "when I'm a script
interpreter, I expect an auxv entry AT_SCRIPT_FD with an  open fd with
CLOEXEC set".  Then we can directly exec scripts by fd, even with
O_CLOEXEC set, without any races.
