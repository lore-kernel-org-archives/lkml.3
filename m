Yes, it's fairly misleading.  What about the instructions it adds to
the fault hotpaths?  The additional memory footprint of each cgroup
created?  You're adding 9 lines to point out one specific cost aspect,
when the entire feature is otherwise summed up in two lines.  The
per-page overhead of memcg is not exceptional or unexpected if you
know what it does - which you should when you enable it, even as a
distributor - and such a gross overrepresentation in the help text is
more confusing than helpful.
