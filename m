Subject: [PATCH V8] kbuild: create a rule to run the pre-processor on *.dts files
Date: Tue,  5 Feb 2013 12:06:28 -0700

Create cmd_dtc_cpp to run the C pre-processor on *.dts file before
passing them to dtc for final compilation. This allows the use of #define
and #include within the .dts file.

Grant, back in mid-November, you said you'd make a decision on this in
the next couple of days, but I think this got overlooked.

v8: Add -undef to the cpp command-line, to prevent e.g. "linux" and "unix"
    being defined; symbols which can appear in the device tree.
v7: Build *.dtb from *.dts not src/*.dts.
v6: No change.
v5:
* Update Documentation/kbuild for the new command and rule.
v4:
* Use -x assembler-with-cpp so pre-defined macros are set up so that
  #included header files know to only use cpp syntax, not C syntax.
* Define __DTS__ for similar reasons.
* use $(CPP) not $(CC) -E, and use $(cpp_flags).
* Save the pre-processed results so they can be easily inspected when
  debugging build issues.
* The use of -x assembler-with-cpp causes cpp to recognize directives in
  column 1 only. Hence, there's no need to escape property names that
  begin with #. Hence, there's no need for separate skeleton.dtsi and
  skeleton.dtsip. Maintain a separate file extension and build rule so that
  CPP-usage is opt-in. In particular, when using CPP, #include must be used
  rather than /include/ so that dependencies work.
v3: Pass "-x c" not "-xc" to cpp.
v2: Place make %.dtb: %.dtsp rule into Makefile.lib.

+	Using the C pre-processor allows use of #define to create named

+	represents a data structure rather than code in C syntax, similar
+	restrictions are placed on a header file included by a device tree
+	file as for a header file included by an assembly language file.
+	In particular, the C pre-processor is passed -x assembler-with-cpp,
+	which sets macro __ASSEMBLY__. __DTS__ is also set. These allow header
