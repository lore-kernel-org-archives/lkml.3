But don't proxies need to override the per-message metadata, too?
This is why I'm confused (and my confusion about what's happening goes
down into the code, too).  IMO it would be great if all the variables
were named things like message_metadata, conn_metadata, bus_metadata,
etc.

I assume that the logic is something like:

connect to bus
request bus metadata
if (bus metadata matches expectations) {
  great, trust the bus!
} else {
  oh crap!
}

If I'm understanding it right, then user code only really has two
outcomes: the good case and the "oh crap!" case.  The problem is that
"oh crap!" isn't a clean failure -- if it happens, then the
application has just been DoSed, because in that case, one of two
things happened:

1. Some policy mismatch means that the legitimate bus owner did create
the bus, but the user application is confused.  This will result in
difficult-to-diagnose failures.

2. A malicious or confused program created the bus.  This is a DoS --
even the legitimate bus creator can't actually create the bus now.

So I think that the policy should be applied at the time that the bus
name is claimed, not at the time that someone else tries to use the
bus.  IOW, the way that you verify you're talking to the system bus
should be by checking that the bus is called "system", not by checking
that UID 0 created the bus.

But you can shove tons of fds in a message, and you can have lots of
messages, and some of the fds can be fds of unix sockets that have fds
queued up in them, and one of those fds could be the fd to the kdbus
connection that sent the fd...

This is not advice as to what to do about it, but I think that it will
be a problem at some point.

But it does -- the creator of the bus binds metadata to that bus at
creation time.

I think that a better solution would be to have a global policy that
says, for example, "to create the bus called 'system', the creator
must have selinux label xyz" or "to create a user bus called
uid-1000-privileged-ui-bus the creator must have some cgroup" or
whatever.

Although maybe a better solution would leave this in the kernel but
allow any cgroup to create a bus with a same that indicates the
creating cgroup.  Then I could have my desktop shell create a
"/cgroup/path/to/desktop" for per-user privileged things.

It seems unfortunate to keep around this really weird behavior for the
benefit of legacy applications.  Could there perhaps be a flag that a
connection can set to indicate that it understands per-destination
access control and therefore wants stricter policy enforcement?

This seems completely at odds with all the fine-grained metadata
stuff.  Also, anything that relies on this may get very confused when
the LSM hooks go in, because I'm reasonably sure that the intent is
for them to *not* follow this principle.

Huh?

Say I have two users, "Sender" and "Receiver", each with a single
connection.  If Receiver owns no well-known names, then Sender can
send to it.  If Receiver owns one well-known name, then Sender needs
to pass a TALK check on that name.  If Reciever owns two well-known
names, then Sender only needs to pass a TALK check on one of them.

Am I understanding this right?  If I am, then I think this is in the
category of baroque and inconsistent security rules which everyone
will screw up and therefore introduce security vulnerabilities.

Can you really not enforce the much simpler rule that, to send to a
name, you must have permission to send to *that* name?  If legacy
dbus1 receivers register two names and don't validate everything
correctly, then only the legacy receivers have problems.

Thanks.  (I assume that memfd has nothing to do with this directly,

NAK, I think.

I agree that PID overflow is a real issue and should be addressed
somehow.  But please address it for real instead of adding Yet Another
Hack (tm).  In the mean time, leave that hack out, please.

I would *love* to see PIDs have extra high bits at the end, done in a
way that supports CRIU and that guarantees no reuse unless something
privileged intentionally mis-programs it.  But starttime isn't that
mechanism.

Use the PID.  Really.  Your wireshark extention can look this crap up

Again, use the PID for tracing, please.

At the very least, make it impossible to specify these fields in the
"must be received" set and rename them to something like
KDBUS_INSTALL_UNRELIABLE_CMDLINE, etc, because they're unreliable

Finally, this stuff should only be readable by privileged users.  And
using the PID accomplishes that.

Transparency is a terrible thing here.

How many users put passwords into things on the command line?  Yes,
it's a bad idea (for reasons that are entirely stupid), but now those
passwords get *logged*.

If this is in the kernel, and someone complains that sensitive data is
showing up on ten different logs on their system, they'll *correctly*
blame the kernel.  If you at least use the PID and restrict it to the
logging code, then at least the bug report will go to the logging
daemon, which will be *correctly* accused of doing something daft, and
it can be fixed.

With all due respect, BS.

I admit that there is probably no reason to deny systemd-based reboot
to a CAP_SYS_BOOT-capable process, but there is absolutely no reason
to give processes that are supposed to reboot using systemd the
CAP_SYS_BOOT capability.

In any event, I suspect you'll have a hard time justifying this for
anything other than CAP_SYS_BOOT.  Just because CAP_SYS_ADMIN users
can probably do whatever they want doesn't mean that systemd should
make that a built-in policy.

Also, wtf is the bounding set and such for?  At the very least this
should only be the effective set.

Because the implementation is buggy and therefore it's insecure?
Remember that caps are namespaced in an interesting way.

No.

Because if receivers opt in to most of these, *they're doing it
wrong*, and the kernel shouldn't be in the business of helping them.

But I thought that the LSM hooks were going to replace all of that.

Can you get a selinux person to confirm that this is actually necessary?

Yeah, I think you're right about this.

If I'm understanding this right, then I think it just needs a
documentation change and possibly a renaming of the metadata item
name.

Fair enough.
