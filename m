I'm sceptical about the kernel offering APIs just because it can.  I'm
not fundamentally opposed to objects (e.g. busses) having ownership
information, but I think it needs to be well-justified.

Keep in mind that the kernel *has* a concept of ownership.  It's uid,
gid, and security label.  Having the creator's full set of caps and
even *command line* as part of the ownership information is really
weird.

But you can open a kdbus fd.  IMO there should be some actual thought
as to what should happen if that credentials change after the fd is
opened.  The default answer in UNIX is that credentials are only
checked at open time.  Violating that should have a good reason.

That would be a fantastic idea, and, in fact, it would have been
vastly better if syscalls had always worked that way.  It's how
anything on a network *has* to work, it's how object capability
systems work (and object capability systems are much less prone to
security bugs caused by overcomplicated implicit checks), and it's how
Capsicum (which builds on POSIX!) works.

I agree that this is convenient, but it's a hack, and we've only
gotten away with it so far because only something that's very much in
the trusted computing base can see this information at all.  And I
strongly suspect that, if I were inclined to try to break SELinux, I
could find any number of rather fundamental holes based on the fact
that it adds checks to capabilities in places where they didn't exist
originally.

Sorry, but this is bogus.  The audit system is a bit of an unstable
mess, and, to all appearances, its main design goal seems to be
regulatory compliance instead of actual security.  It seems to be
mostly harmless, but only because all of the data gathered by auditd
that should never have existed in the first place can only be
collected by an extremely privileged global daemon and is shoved in
logs that no one outside the TCB can read.

If you want a configurable-out off-by-default bolt-on system that
allows auditd (and nothing else!) to sniff kdbus busses and log
whatever random crap it wants to log (and keep it the hell out of the
part of the journal that unprivileged users can see), then do so.

This is nonsense.  If you don't need real access control on user
busses, then *don't add any*.

Except that you *do* need real access control, because of containers,
seccomp, the Chromium sandbox, the upcoming Firefox sandbox, all of
the other little sandboxes that should exist but don't yet, remoting,
etc.  And I guarantee that your list of implicitly transmitted
credentials will fail to handle this case, and this case is the only
one that really matters.  At the end of the day, you're going to need
either crypto, something like object capabilities, or an access
broker.  And none of those benefit at all from the current proposed
model.  (And none of them check anything like implicit credentials at
the time of an RPC call, either.)

Interestingly, it sounds to be like traditional D-Bus will work
considerably better than kdbus in this scenario.

As a concrete example, Wayland takes sensitive operations like
screenshots very seriously.  Which of the kdbus metadata items would
be appropriate to use for access control for something like that?

See above.  The sysadmin != every single kdbus user.

Sorry, but this is a bit off the deep end.  The kdbus logging
mechanism shouldn't be in the business of trying to do this, because
it's out of scope, and it will fail.

You can't justify logging fundamentally unverifiable things like the
command line by saying that you want to know if someone tries to play
(impossible-to-reliably-detect) games to obscure their command line.
