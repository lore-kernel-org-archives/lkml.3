Am I reading the discussion correctly that the new warnings show REAL potential 
deadlock scenarios, which can hit real users and can lock their box up in entirely 
real usage scenarios?

If yes then guys we _really_ don't want to use lockdep annotation to _HIDE_ bugs.
We typically use them to teach lockdep about things it does not know about.

How about fixing the deadlocks instead?
