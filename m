Hi Serge,

I admit that the global resources related audit message should be logged to
parent and ancestor. but this is more complex than the way I implemented.
Because we should send message to all ancestor and we should consider not
to exceed the rate_limit of all ancestor.

I prefer to don't make these filters/rules per user namespace right now.

In my option, the audit rules(inode, tree_list, filter) , some of audit
controller related resources(enabled,pid,portid...) and skb queue, audit
netlink sockets,kauditd thread should be per-userns. The audit user message
which generated by the user in container should be per-userns too.

Since netns is not implemented as a hierarchy, and the network related
resources are not global. so network related audit message should be per-userns too.

The security related audit message should be send to init user namespace
as we discussed before. Maybe tty related audit message should be send
to init user namespace too, I have no idea now.

The next step, I will post a new patchset which only make the audit user
message and the basic audit resource per userns. I think this patchset
will easy to be reviewed and accepted, And will not influence the host.
This patchset contains the below patches:

Gao feng (21):
  Audit: make audit kernel side netlink sock per userns
  netlink: Add compare function for netlink_table
  Audit: implement audit self-defined compare function
  Audit: make audit_skb_queue per user namespace
  Audit: make audit_skb_hold_queue per user namespace
  Audit: make kauditd_task per user namespace
  Audit: make audit_pid per user namespace
  Audit: make audit_nlk_portid per user namesapce
  Audit: make audit_enabled per user namespace
  Audit: make audit_ever_enabled per user namespace
  Audit: make audit_initialized per user namespace
  Audit: only allow init user namespace to change rate limit
  Audit: only allow init user namespace to change audit_failure
  Audit: allow to send netlink message to auditd in uninit user
    namespace
  Audit: make kauditd_wait per user namespace
  Audit: make audit_backlog_wait per user namespace
  Audit: introduce new audit logging interface for user namespace
  Audit: pass proper user namespace to audit_log_common_recv_msg
  Audit: Log audit config change in uninit user namespace
  Audit: send reply message to the auditd in proper user namespace
  Audit: Allow GET,SET,USER MSG operations in uninit user namespace

Do you have any comments or advice to this plan? After the above patchs
been accepted, I think it's easy to push other audit namespace related
patches into upstream.

Thanks,
Gao
