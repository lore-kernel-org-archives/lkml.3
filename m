I'm not sure if I'm off base here, but maybe this would make sense: check
for a corrupted stack in __might_sleep.  Compile tested only,
possibly inelegant, and/or completely wrong, but:


From: Eric Sandeen <sandeen@redhat.com>

sched: Test for corrupted task_struct in __might_sleep

If a thread overruns the stack, it may corrupt the task_struct,
leading to false positives on tests like irqs_disabled().

Warn if this seems to be the case.
