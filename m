Dave has made it clear that he doesn't want to be involved in maintaining
-stable kernels.  However, my team at SGI is interested in maintaining -stable
kernels.  We're not going to use the fact that there is a risk of regression as
an excuse to starve -stable of relevant fixes, just as we do not use it as an
excuse to starve the upstream branch of feature content.

Here are the usual suspects:

Ben Myers <bpm@sgi.com>
Mark Tinguely <tinguely@sgi.com>
Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>
Eric Sandeen <sandeen@redhat.com>

Much appreciated.
