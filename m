Writing past end of file in Windows can be very slow, but note that it
is possible for a windows to set as sparse a file on an NTFS
partition.   Quoting from
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365566%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
Windows NTFS does support sparse files (and we could even send it over
cifs if we want) but it has to be explicitly set by the app on the
file:

"To determine whether a file system supports sparse files, call the
GetVolumeInformation function and examine the
FILE_SUPPORTS_SPARSE_FILES bit flag returned through the
lpFileSystemFlags parameter.

Most applications are not aware of sparse files and will not create
sparse files. The fact that an application is reading a sparse file is
transparent to the application. An application that is aware of
sparse-files should determine whether its data set is suitable to be
kept in a sparse file. After that determination is made, the
application must explicitly declare a file as sparse, using the
FSCTL_SET_SPARSE control code."
