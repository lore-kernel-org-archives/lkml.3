You are right, the test doesn't count with bigalloc. I was able to trigger the test failure by using MKFS_OPTIONS="-O bigalloc -C 8192"

If I understood it correctly, the dumpe2fs outputs free blocks even if bigalloc is used, that is only the first block of the cluster. I changed the test to count with whole cluster. Please try the following patch to the xfstests if it helps you. I tried different cluster sizes from 8192 to 65536 and it works for me.

Thank you!

Subject: [PATCH] xfstests: 298: fix failure on ext4 with bigalloc

Count with cluster size instead of block size if bigalloc is used.
