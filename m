Why?  Concretely, why should this be in the kernel namespace code
instead of in userspace?

So don't let them out.  None of the other namespaces have this kind of
constraint:

 - If you're in a mntns, you can still use fds from outside.
 - If you're in a netns, you can still use sockets from outside the namespace.
 - If you're in an ipcns, you can still use ipc handles from outside.

etc.

I actually think it makes the semantics more complex.  The less policy
you stick in the kernel, the easier it is to understand the impact of
that policy.

The process should see the cgroup path relative to its cgroup ns.
Whether this requires a new /proc mount or happens automatically is an
open question.  (I *hate* procfs for reasons like this.)

Open question.

You could disallow that and instead require 'mount -t cgroup -o
cgrouproot=. cgroup mnt' where '.' will be resolved at mount time
relative to the caller's cgroupns.

Why not?
