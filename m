Agreed.

But I do not think that removing just the test is the right way to go.
It is mem_cgroup_reparent_charges which bothers me because it loops
until the current counter falls down to 0 and it also feels strange that
a group can hand over pages up the hierarchy (or even to an unlimitted
root if this is a top of a hierarchy).

So I think that we want to get rid of reparenting as well.  The main use
case as described by the documentation is:
"
  The typical use case for this interface is before calling rmdir().
  Because rmdir() moves all pages to parent, some out-of-use page caches can be
  moved to the parent. If you want to avoid that, force_empty will be useful.
"

rmdir will reparent pages implicitly so the reclaim part should be
sufficient and it would be OK even with existing tasks. Subgroups would
be little bit more tricky because the user doesn't have any control over
which group of the hierarchy will get reclaimed.

Anyway, the knob sucks - for the similar reasons why drop_cache sucks -
especially when the check would be gone and it would be another way how
to trigger reclaim anytime. Having the check doesn't prevent from races
but it at least prevents abuse.

So I would be rather for dropping the knob altogether, but that seems to
be a long term thing. So let's start with deprecating it + remove the
check with dropping reparenting part.

What do you think about the following patch instead:

Subject: [PATCH] memcg: remove tasks/children test from from
 mem_cgroup_force_empty

Tejun has correctly pointed out that tasks/children test in
mem_cgroup_force_empty is not correct because there is no other locking
which preserves this state throughout the rest of the function so both
new tasks can join the group or new children groups can be added while
somebody is writing to memory.force_empty. A new task would break
mem_cgroup_reparent_charges expectation that all failures as described
by mem_cgroup_force_empty_list are temporal and there is no way out.

The main use case for the knob as described by
Documentation/cgroups/memory.txt is to:
"
  The typical use case for this interface is before calling rmdir().
  Because rmdir() moves all pages to parent, some out-of-use page caches can be
  moved to the parent. If you want to avoid that, force_empty will be useful.
"

This means that reparenting is not really required as rmdir will
reparent pages implicitly from the safe context. If we remove it from
mem_cgroup_force_empty then we are safe even with existing tasks because
the number of reclaim attempts is bounded. Moreover the knob still does
what the documentation claims (modulo reparenting which doesn't make any
difference) and users might expect. Longterm we want to deprecate the
whole knob and put the reparented pages to the tail of parent LRU during
cgroup removal.
