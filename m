It's all NFS's fault!

At this point, we have a sibcall to call_connect() I think. The RPC task
of discourse happens to be local, and as the relevant comment says

		 * We want the AF_LOCAL connect to be resolved in the
		 * filesystem namespace of the process making the rpc
		 * call.  Thus we connect synchronously.

Probably this should be doing this only if said namespace isn't
disconnected and going away...

This is happening because of this code in net/sunrpc/svc.c (and, indeed,
I am running rpcbind, like everyone should be these days):

/*
 * If user space is running rpcbind, it should take the v4 UNSET
 * and clear everything for this [program, version].  If user space
 * is running portmap, it will reject the v4 UNSET, but won't have
 * any "inet6" entries anyway.  So a PMAP_UNSET should be sufficient
 * in this case to clear all existing entries for [program, version].
 */
static void __svc_unregister(struct net *net, const u32 program, const u32 version,
			     const char *progname)
{
	int error;

	error = rpcb_v4_register(net, program, version, NULL, "");

	/*
	 * User space didn't support rpcbind v4, so retry this
	 * request with the legacy rpcbind v2 protocol.
	 */
	if (error == -EPROTONOSUPPORT)
		error = rpcb_register(net, program, version, 0, 0);


Ah yes, because what unregister should do is *register* something.
That's clear as mud :)

I don't think it is a random process context. It's all intentionally
done in the context of the process which is the last to close that
filesystem, as part of the process of tearing it down -- but it looks
like the NFS svcrpc connection code isn't expecting to be called in that
situation.
