  Because I think this interface should not be used by a regular
applications, the only purpose is to restore the @ticks after
checkpoint. Requiring CAP_SYS_RESOURCE means that at least
program which use it knows what it's doing.

  Still if someone has a scenarion where we might need this
intarface out of this cap requirement -- we always can
drop it of without breaking existing users, but not the
reverse.

P.S. I remember Thomas' words about existence of the other
word out of c/r, still I treat this ioctl as exception
(as in prctl codes we use for c/r).
