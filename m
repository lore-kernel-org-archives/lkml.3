We were seeing deadlocks on suspend that were root caused to locks
held at freeze time. In this case, the locks were device locks. I
wanted a way to detect if a process tried to freeze with a device_lock
held.

Then I thought about the cgroup_freezer subsystem (which I recently
turned on in our system). If you were to freeze a cgroup and a process
were holding a lock, you could deadlock. Seems reasonable that this
code path could cause a deadlock that way.

The problem is that freezer_count() calls try_to_freeze(). In this
case, try_to_freeze() is not really adding any value.

If we didn't try_to_freeze() in this instance of freezer_count() you'd
avoid the potential deadlock and not block suspend. I think a lot of
call sites are like that. They want to avoid blocking suspend but
aren't really interested in trying to freeze at the moment they call
freezer_count().

Mandeep
