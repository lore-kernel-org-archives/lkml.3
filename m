You were fooled by its generic name!  It really is a lot less generic
than what it was designed for, and there are no new users in sight.

The reason I did it this way is because the hugetlb controller simply
accounts and limits a certain type of memory and in the future I would
like to make it a memcg extension, just like kmem and swap.

Once that is done, page counters can become fully private, but until
then I think it's a good idea to make them part of memcg to express
this relationship and to ensure we are moving in the same direction.

Thanks!
