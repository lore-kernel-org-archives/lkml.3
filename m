Rafael:

The series Bjorn mentions is at https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/7/11  It
converts both the "ACPI Hot Plug PCI Controller Driver ("acpiphp")" and
"ACPI PCI Slot Detection Driver ("pci_slot")" sub-drivers to built-in
drivers (i.e. no longer supported as modules).

Yinghai commented back - https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/7/29 - indicating
a possible issue with such but his response was too terse for me to get
anything from.  Also, I've noticed that a couple of the distros, debian
being one, have made similar changes so I'm a little skeptical about
Yinghai's concerns.

Since you have similar thoughts - "I really don't see a value in having
a modular pci_slot driver" - can you foresee any issues with such?

Thanks,
 Myron
