Who is doing such thing?

Usually if you unlock, you exit from function, or you already done
iteration through the list.

Like
lock()
list_for_each_safe() {
  if (condition) {
  list_del()
  unlock()
  return;
 }
}
unlock()
return;

In case you have to do unlock()/lock() routine inside iteration you always can
do an additional check at the end

list_for_each_safe() {
 unlock();
 lock();
}
if (!list_empty()) {
do_smth()
}
unlock();

Thus, I don't see how list*del will help.
