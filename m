That sounds like a good thing to have.  Every single linux user
depends on the dcache.  Only a relatively small subset cares about
perf.  Having dcache pay the cost for perf's special needs is a
classical externality.

Agreed.  The whole approach is based on getting the 99% case right and
occasionally being wrong.  For perf this may be acceptable, not sure.
