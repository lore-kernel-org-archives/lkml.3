The problem is that the label you actually want has already been set and you
have to be careful not to overwrite it.

The other hook (->inode_copy_up) is called first to label the destination
inode - and that has access to the source file also so it can label the
destination with consideration of the attributes on the source.  Normally, the
attributes on the source will be in memory attached to the source inode, I
would imagine.
