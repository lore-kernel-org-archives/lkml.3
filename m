I was thinking of adding something to selftests that would check that
__vdso_findsym can find every exported symbol, check that it can't
find the ones it shouldn't find, and call it on a bunch of garbage
strings to make sure it rejects them.

It's certainly easy.  It's a little gross, and I sort of feel bad
about having two parallel ways of referring to a vdso function -- one
used by ELF parsers and one used by the new thing.  Using an array
also wins on speed and code size.  *sigh* -- I'm torn on this one.

Do you know why the vdso uses symbol versioning and weak symbols in
the first place?  This seems to date back all the way to the beginning
(2aae950b21e4bc789d1fc6668faf67e8748300b7).  If we're going to add a
new way to find vdso symbols, I would like to at least drop support
for versions.
