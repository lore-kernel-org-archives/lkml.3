I don't think it's really that unusual. IO ports are weird, they're
not necessarily emulating any kind of normal memory - doing a 32-bit
access on IO port 0 isn't necessarily equivalent at all to doing
separate 8-bit accesses on IO ports 0, 1, 2 and 3 for example. They
can do completely different things. For legacy SFF ATA controllers,
IIRC most of the IO ports only expect 8-bit accesses other than the
PIO data register which can do 16 or 32-bit accesses (which just gives
you a different amount of data when doing different size reads from
the same location - it doesn't give you the data for the IO ports 2 or
3 bytes ahead of that when doing a 32-bit read, like you might expect
if you were thinking of it like memory). So it's not too shocking that
the designer of these Marvell devices didn't pay too much attention to
what happens if you access the ports in an unexpected way.

Most devices tend not to use IO ports any more in favor of MMIO,
except for legacy devices or devices implementing a legacy interface
(like the SFF ATA portion of these Marvell controllers). In those old
setups, doing funny things with IO port space is more common. Also,
the fact that IO port space tends to be somewhat precious leads to
this sort of thing too.

Perhaps not "countless" but more "uncountable" in that there's no real
way to tell which devices may have issues, only to know that it's
quite possible that many devices may.
