From
mounted filesystem with  Opts: (null)
re-mounted. Opts:(null)

To

mounted filesystem with (null) mount option(s)
re-mounted (null) mount option(s)

That (null) could change to no or none I suppose but it still feels a bit off thou maybe this output sample would be better?

if = (null)

mounted filesystem
re-mounted filesystem

elif

mounted filesystem with x,y.x mount option(s)
re-mounted filesystem with x,y.x mount option(s)
