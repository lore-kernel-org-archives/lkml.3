Subject: Re: [PATCH v2] Setting the IORESOURCE_ROM_SHADOW flag on a VGA card other than the primary prevents it from reading it's own rom. It will get the content of the shadowrom at C000 instead, which is of the primary VGA card and the driver of the secondary card will bail out.

Hi All,

Still trying to collect tested and acked-by's ..

Dave,
          In commit 6cf20beec4b91c240cf759b4db72669e251f1fc4 you changed pci_fixup_video saying:
          "This fixes the switcheroo on my T410s."
          Do you still have the machine and could you verify if it still works with this patch applied ?

Eiichiro,
          Most of last major overhaul of pci_fixup_video was in commit 6b5c76b8e2ff204fa8d7201acce461188873bf2b saying:
          "PCI: fix pci_fixup_video as it blows up on sparc64"
          Is it possible for you to verify you can still boot on sparc64 with this patch applied ?

Tony,
          Since ia64's pci_fixup_video is also changed to be inline with x86, could you verify it still compiles and boots for you ?


Konrad,
          Thanks for reviewing and testing !
