Ok, I had feared that would be a consequence of this patch.  I think the
problem is that the usb-storage driver submitted an URB with more
scatter-gather entries than would fit on the ring segment, the xHCI
driver rejected the URB with -ENOMEM, and the SCSI core eventually gave
up on the SCSI command.

Do you have CONFIG_USB_DEBUG turned on for 3.13?  If so, you should see
dmesg output from this statement shortly before your drive fails:

if (num_trbs >= TRBS_PER_SEGMENT) {
	xhci_err(xhci, "Too many fragments %d, max %d\n",
		num_trbs, TRBS_PER_SEGMENT - 1);
	return -ENOMEM;
}

Unfortunately a real fix for this is going to take a bit.  I have a
couple different solutions to the bug the patch solved, but they're much
more invasive than the original patch and will take a couple weeks to
implement and thoroughly test.

If David's patch is just reverted, USB ethernet on 3.12 and later breaks
under xHCI.  The networking folks added scatter-gather support in 3.12.
Those patches could be reverted, but I suspect David Miller will not be
happy with that solution, since the real problem is the xHCI driver
itself, and EHCI scatter-gather works fine.

I think the short term solution is to simply turn off scatter-gather all
together under xHCI until this gets fixed.  It could mean a big
performance hit for USB storage devices, but that means we get correct
behavior for both USB ethernet and USB storage.

Nope, you're fine.  I've Cc'ed the USB and SCSI mailing lists as well.
