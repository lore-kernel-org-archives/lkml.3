Yes I had thought of just dropping our locks everytime we had to do
find_next_key() but that isn't going to work.  We do have to save state but
that's not the hard part, it's the fact that we could race with the committing
transaction and lose space.  So what would happen is something like this

caching_thread:
	save last cached offset
	drop locks
	find_next_key
		get a ref on the current commit root
		search down to the next leaf
	re-take locks
	process leaf

transaction committer:
	acquire locks
	swap commit root
	write transaction
	unpin all extents up to the last saved cached offset

So if the caching thread grabs a ref on the commit root before the transaction
committer swaps out the commit root we are dealing with too old of a tree.  So
say the leaf we're going to process next has data that was free'ed (and
therefore would have been unpinned) during that transaction, because it is after
our last cached offset we don't unpin it because we know that the caching thread
is going to find the leaf where that extent is not there and add free space for
that extent.  However we got the leaf from two transactions ago which will still
show that extent in use, so we won't add free space for it, which will cause us
to leak the extent.  We need to make sure we are always consistently on the
previous extent root which is why we hold this lock.

I hope that makes sense.  Thanks,

Josef
