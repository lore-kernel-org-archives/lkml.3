Although I don't mind the patch below, I don't think the bitfield thing
happened because anyone was confused about what the compiler would do;
here, it's more a case of legacy code that came out from under the
Big Kernel Lock and the bitfield was an oversight.

However, my patch to fix it by splitting the bitfield into 4 bytes
was rejected as insufficient to prevent accidental sharing. This is
what spun off the Alpha discussion about non-atomic byte updates.

FWIW, there are a bunch of problems with both the documentation and
kernel code if adjacent bytes can be overwritten by a single byte write.

Documentation/atomic-ops.txt claims that properly aligned chars are
atomic in the same sense that ints are, which is not true on the Alpha
(hopefully not a possible optimization on other arches -- I tried
with the ia64 cross compiler but it stuck with byte-sized writes).

Pretty much any large aggregate kernel structure is bound to have some
byte-size fields that are either lockless or serialized by different
locks, which may be corrupted by concurrent updates to adjacent data.
IOW, ACCESS_ONCE(), spinlocks, whatever, doesn't prevent adjacent
byte-sized data from being overwritten. I haven't bothered to count
how many global bools/chars there are and whether they might be
overwritten by adjacent updates.

Documentation/circular-buffers.txt and any lockless implementation based
on or similar to it for bytes or shorts will be corrupted if the head
nears the tail.

I'm sure there's other interesting outcomes that haven't come to light.

I think that 'naturally aligned scalar writes are atomic' should be the
minimum arch guarantee.

Regards,
Peter Hurley
