Sure thing.

No, we don't.  __DEVEL__sane_behavior is a tool to implement unified
hierarchy.  Once unified hierarchy lands, sane_behavior will be folded
into unified hierarchy.

So, they're one and the same.

Please see at the end of the mail.

If it is a debug knob, let's please require it to be enabled
explicitly - ie. require a boot param which *clearly* indicates that
this is a debug option; otherwise, we end up leaking internal details
w/o actually intending or designing for it and userland is likely to
grow dependency on it.

AFAIK, google folks forked cfq a couple years ago, I'm not sure how
much this will affect them.

Can we do that once we know for sure that this is actually necessary?
I'm quite skeptical that this sort of snapshot stats are actually
useful except for debugging.

The same thing with above.  If these are really for debugging, let's
please hide them better.

Yeah, thought about keeping them consistent but would that really
matter?  Having internal consistency in cfq seems more important to
me.

Ditto.

I'm not sure whether we want to rename throttle knobs.  Renaming cfq
knobs makes sense as they need to be renamed for cfq. prefix anyway
but throttle knobs are already mostly fine, so wouldn't it make sense
to leave them as they are?  It makes things a bit incosistent between
cfq and throttle but do we really care?

Again, sane_behavior is subset of unified hierarchy and will be
absorbed into unified hierarchy.  No need to make the distinction.

Because I'm not sure about the benefits and it makes cfq behave
differently from other controllers.  root cgroup behavior probably has
to be special per controller so there's nothing fundamentally wrong
with that.  I just am not sure whether this actually adds something
significantly beneficial and it's kinda silly to commit to things when
not really necessary.  Adding things later is easy, removing is not,
so...

Thanks.
