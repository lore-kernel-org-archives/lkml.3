I'm not sure to understand you, revoke if implemented correctly is not a
bad thing! In the other hand, here I try to explain what if the target task
did not execve, revoke will never be involved, file descriptors are
still valid!

Sorry, can't follow you here! examples related to what we discuss here ?

Well, yes we don't agree perhaps on the fix, but currently there are no
other fixes, will be happy to see other propositions! these files have
been vulnerable for years now...

And for the record it's not my approache. Please just read the emails
correctly. It was proposed and suggested by Eric and perhaps Linus.

I did an experiment with it, and found it easy without any extra
overhead: If cred have changed do extra checkes on the original opener.
It will let you pass file descritors if cred did not change.


Where is this other email that says this approach is hard?
It's not hard, very minor change and it works. Perhaps there is a
better solution yes, but currently it's not implemented!

If you see any bug or if it's not right: then please show us an example,
that's it.


Thanks Andy
