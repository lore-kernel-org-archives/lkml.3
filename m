Thanks, Neil. Changed as you suggest. I'd quite like to mention
which of /proc/fs/nfsd/nfsv4{lease,grace}time is relevant here. I had a 
quick scan, but could not determine it with complete confidence. My suspicion, 
looking at fs/lockd/svcproc.c and fs/lockd/grace.c::locks_in_grace()
is that it is /proc/fs/nfsd/nfsv4gracetime that is relevant here. Can anyone
confirm?

Cheers,

Michael
