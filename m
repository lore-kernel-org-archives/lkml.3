I absolutely do not care one whit for that. The kernel lives, deal with
it.

Memory barriers are hard enough, we do not need multiple versions of the
same thing just to confuse people.

The conversion shrank the memory barrier API by 4 variants while
covering more cases, which is an absolute win in my book.
