I think the larger point is that it really is an extension of the
existing kludge.  As mentioned before, cdb filtering itself isn't
something desirable.  It was added as a kludge to work around CD
burning problem.  We should have limited to MMC devices from the
beginning but forgot that and it of course developed uses which were
never intended which in turn pushes the expansion of the kludge.

The primary point where we don't see eye-to-eye is how manageable we
find SG_IO to be.  I have deep seated distrust on exposing SG_IOs in
controlled way.  The drivers try really hard to avoid certain command
sequences or sub-operations.  We end up with all sorts of black and
white lists and careful code sequences grown over time to avoid
obscure issues.

If the userland is trusted enough to be responsible for all that, it's
fine and that's what "count me out" knob is about which makes sense to
me.  Per-cdb filtering to a lesser security domain, not so much.  An
argument could be made that, as a side effect of the misused cdb
filter, we already have it and might as well expand on it; however, as
Martin reiterated in this thread, this is a fundamentally broken
approach.  Well, it at least seems that way to me.

So, what I'm asking is not about splitting the patches in extreme
granularity or adding absurd amount of details, but more the general
discussion and justification of the approach taken for prospect use
cases and how the commands being added would be part of such approach.

Then let's make it fit the use case better.  I really can't see much
point in crafting the cdb filter when you basically have to entrust
the device to the user anyway.  Let's either trust the user with the
device or not.  I'm very doubtful that the filtered access via SG_IO
can be reliable or secure enough.  Let's please avoid extending a
broken thing.

Can you elaborate?  Why can't a tape device be entrusted to the user?
