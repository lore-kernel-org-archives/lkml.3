Yes, my concern is for the IO resource case of _TTP=0 and _TRA !=0. The
only reason for this case I think of is that the IO resource offsets on
the prime bus and second bus are different. In this case, we still need
to pass _TRA to new_space() and the finial resource->start still should 
be acpi_resource->min + offset returned by add_io_space(), right?

If yes, I think _TRA can't be applied to IO resource in the
acpi_dev_resource_address_space() regardless of the value of _TTP.

BTW, Translation Sparse(_TRS) is only meaningful if _TTP is set.(Table 
6-185). The add_io_space() doesn't check _TTP when set sparse. So this 
should be corrected?
