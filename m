The TIF_SECCOMP is needed for the syscall entry path. The check in
secure_computing() is just because the "I am being traced" trigger
includes a call to secure_computing, which filters out tracing
reasons.

Your fast path work would clean a lot of that up, as you say. But it
still doesn't change the ordering check here. TIF_SECCOMP indicates
seccomp.mode must be checked, so that ordering will remain, and if
mode == FILTER, seccomp.filter must be valid.

Isn't there a way we can force the assignment ordering in seccomp_assign_mode()?
