VPD pages are found in SPC (ANSI INCITS 301-1997) and many of its
drafts. By SPC-2 (ANSI INCITS 351-2001) the "supported VPD pages"
VPD page (0x0) ** and the "device identification" VPD page (0x83)
were mandatory (in SPC those pages were optional). So that is
approaching 20 years for manufacturers to get used to VPD pages.

TRIM is a T13 term (ATA/SATA) that was introduced after 2001
(i.e. after SBC-2). The corresponding SCSI term is now
"Logical Block Provisioning" (LBP). This covers the SCSI
UNMAP command (closest thing to TRIM) and the SCSI WRITE SAME
command which contains LBP options.

LBP capability was originally reported in the SCSI READ
CAPACITY(16) command (but not the more common READ
CAPACITY(10) command); namely the LBPME and LBPRZ bits. Those
bits have been renamed *** during the lifetime of SBC-3 drafts.
Those bits and a lot of additional LBP information are now
found in two VPD pages: "Block Limits" (0xb0) and "Logical
Block Provisioning" (0xb2).


After a 36 byte standard INQUIRY response, unless the
compliance is stone age (e.g. SCSI-2 or earlier) then
a 36 byte INQUIRY with the EVPD bit set and page=0
should be pretty safe. Check the response carefully
as USB devices will often ignore the EVPD bit and respond
with a standard INQUIRY response. Forget any such devices.
Now look for either of those LBP supporting VPD pages.
There should not be too many devices that support neither
and do LBP.
