If we're corrupting on abort that is a bug too that needs to be fixed
too.  I've banged on the abort stuff a lot recently when trying to
make it not panic the box and it appears to work fine.  Obviously that
kind of stuff needs to be tested as well, but so far I haven't seen
abort corrupt the file system.  Thanks,
