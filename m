Yes, it works! I recompiled at commit 
762380ad9322951cea4ce9d24864265f9c66a916 with your patch and it looks 
ok. Rebooted back to the unpatched kernel and the bug showed up again 
immediately.

The funny thing is that the problem only showed on my (multi-disk) btrfs 
filesystem. / which is on ext4 seems to work fine.
