Probably; and this in-kernel buffered fallback is particularly desirable
for nfsd when the exported fs doesn't provide .copy_range.  Having nfsd
service the COPY op is still a significant win over having the client
move the data backand forth over the wire.

But in that quote above I was talking about implementing .copy_range in
ext4 as though it could use XCOPY today.  I'd like to get a feel for how
bad it's going to be to juggle the bio XCOPY IO with unwritten extent
conversion, RMW with overlapping existing blocks, i_size advancing, etc.
(It's so much like O_DIRECT that I'm already crying a little.)
