Removed LinMing@intel

Hi James,

Sorry for the late reply, as I'm just picking up this work and thought
this may still need some discussion/clarification. Please see below.

My understanding of quiesce state is that, it is used by scsi driver to
say: hold on for a moment, no more FS requests, I need to do some
housekeeping work for the device and when I'm done, I'll put it back to
normal state.

The housekeeping work will generally involve executing some commands for
the device using scsi_execute, as all requests originated from
scsi_execute are of type REQ_PREEMPT. But it is not for suspending the
device.

While for runtime suspended state, we can't say: everybody quiet, I'm
gonna sleep, so I'll ignore all of your requests. Instead, we keep track
of the device's activity, and once we have learned that it is not being
used by anyone, we put it into a low power state. And if there is any
requests arrived for it due to whatever user, we will need to resume it
to process the request.

So I think they are different, serves for different purposes.

The nr_pending is the counter of how many requests are in the device's
request queue, while the device_busy is how many commands are being
processed by the device, and they can be different as Alan Stern has put
it here:
http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-scsi/msg60497.html

And I think we still need device_busy in scsi layer, for the case when
the scsi prepare phase decides to defer the request(due to no memory or
whatever), we will have 1 request in the queue while no commands are
being processed by the device. And we need to keep track of such
information in order to decide if we need restart the queue when we
return BLKPREP_DEFER in function scsi_prep_return:

        case BLKPREP_DEFER:
                /*
                 * If we defer, the blk_peek_request() returns NULL, but the
                 * queue must be restarted, so we schedule a callback to happen
                 * shortly.
                 */
                if (sdev->device_busy == 0)
                        blk_delay_queue(q, SCSI_QUEUE_DELAY);
                break;

So I think we still need device_busy.

OK, this is my understanding, they may be wrong, so please let me know
what do you think, thanks.
