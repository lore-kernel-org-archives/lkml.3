Dunno.

I thought that this code was what set MNT_LOCKED for things that
should be locked:

    /* Don't allow unprivileged users to reveal what is under a mount */
    if ((flag & CL_UNPRIVILEGED) && list_empty(&old->mnt_expire))
        mnt->mnt.mnt_flags |= MNT_LOCKED;

Now I'm confused.  Shouldn't that be checking for submounts?  Is that
what it's doing?

Anyway, I think that this should unconditionally set MNT_LOCKED on the
thing that mounted on rootfs.
