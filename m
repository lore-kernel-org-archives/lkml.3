Looks like this is some large security xattr, or enough smaller
xattrs to exceed the ~120 bytes of in-inode xattr storage.  How
big is the SELinux xattr (assuming that is what it is)?

This is about a 65% hit rate, which seems reasonable.

You could try a few different things here:
- disable selinux completely (boot with "selinux=0" on the kernel
  command line) and see how much faster it is
- format your ext4 filesystem with larger inodes (-I 512) and see
  if this is an improvement or not.  That depends on the size of
  the selinux xattrs and if they will fit into the extra 256 bytes
  of xattr space these larger inodes will give you.  The performance
  might also be worse, since there will be more data to read/write
  for each inode, but it would avoid seeking to the xattr blocks.

Cheers, Andreas
