  Just a small correction - it was aim7 AFAIK which isn't closed source
(anymore). You can download it from SourceForge
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/aimbench/files/aim-suite7/Initial%20release/).
Now I have some reservations about what the benchmark does but historically
it has found quite a few issues for us as well.

  Well, neither am I ;) But it is obvious the patch speeds up
log_start_commit() by 'a bit' (taking spinlock, disabling irqs, ...). And
apparently 'a bit' is noticeable for particular workload on a particular
machine - commit statistics Eric provided showed that clearly. I'd still be
happier if Eric also told us how much log_start_commit() calls there were
so that one could verify that 'a bit' could indeed multiply to a measurable
difference. But given how simple the patch is, I gave away after a while
and just merged it...
