Thanks for finding this!  I think we should push this to Linus right
away, and not wait for the next merge window.  The bug has been here
for a long time, but it was unmasked by the fact that we unbroke
extent zeroing in 3.9-rcX.

I have two big questions.  (1) Shouldn't Eric Whitney have picked this
up with his ARM pandaboard testing, since IIRC it's big-endian as
well?  If not, is there something we can do to improve our testing wrt
to big-endian systems?

And (2) does it make sense to have an inline function
ext4_ext_set_len(len)?  It might save some lines of code, but more
importantly, it might make it less likely that we will overlook this
sort of bug in the future.
