I think we should just require two. One for measuring rate in terms
of IOPS and other for measuring rate in terms of [kMG]B/sec.

So exporting both sector and bytes seems redundant. May be exporting
bytes and dropping sector interface will do. Is size of sector exported
somewhere so that user space can easily convert bytes to sector if needed.

Number of bio/requests also will need to be exported so that one can come
up with IOPS.

Thanks
