You are right. Uncontended futex is very fast since it never goes into 
kernel. Queuing problem happens when the lock holder has been 
pre-empted. Adaptive spinning does the smart thing os spin-waiting only 
if the lock holder is still running on another core. If lock holder is 
not scheduled on any core, even adaptive spinning has to go into the 
kernel to be put on wait queue. What would avoid queuing problem and 
reduce the cost of contention is a combination of adaptive spinning, and 
a way to keep the lock holder running on one of the cores just a little 
longer so it can release the lock. Without creating special case and a 
new API in kernel, one way I can think of accomplishing the second part 
is to boost the priority of lock holder when contention happens and 
priority ceiling is meant to do exactly that. Priority ceiling 
implementation in glibc boosts the priority by calling into scheduler 
which does incur the cost of a system call. Priority boost is a reliable 
solution that does not change scheduling semantics. The solution 
allowing lock holder to use one extra timeslice is not a definitive 
solution but tpcc workload shows it does work and it works without 
requiring changes to database locking code.

Theoretically a new locking library that uses both these techniques will 
help solve the problem but being a new locking library, there is a big 
unknown of what new problems, performance and otherwise, it will bring 
and database has to recode to this new library. Nevertheless this is the 
path I am exploring now. The challenge being how to do this without 
requiring changes to database code or the kernel. The hooks available to 
me into current database code are schedctl_init(), schedctl_start() and 
schedctl_stop() which are no-op on Linux at this time. Database folks 
can replace these no-ops with real code in their library to solve the 
queuing problem. schedctl_start() and schedctl_stop() are called only 
when one of the highly contended locks is acquired or released. 
schedctl_start() is called after the lock has been acquired which means 
I can not rely upon it to solve contention issue. schedctl_stop() is 
called after the lock has been released.

Thanks,
Khalid
