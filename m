There's nothing stopping any other distro (or commercial entity) from 
adopting targetcli-fb. I don't know why they haven't, except that 
there's a default attitude that the originator of the project is the 
"upstream" forever.

I think I've done a pretty good job maintaining -fb over the past two 
years -- -fb has bug tracking, a list, tarballs, and is actively 
maintained and improved, all things that are not true of upstream.

My question to you (Nick) is, why don't we all just unify on -fb?
