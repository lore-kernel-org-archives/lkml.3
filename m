I realized that maybe you mean this branch:

if (bio->bi_vcnt > 1 && (BIOVEC_PHYS_MERGEABLE(bvec-1, bvec)))

right?
In this case the branch is not even reached in the original code because
the function returned an error way before executing it (line 760)

There was already a patchset trying to modify the code in a different way than mine:

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/linux.kernel/3IanUpBVhFQ/3Xbg3yLRFp4J

but it has been ignored and in my opinion it takes a more
complicated approach.
