Hello, Jeff.

Hmmm... I tried it a couple years ago while I was working on ptrace
improvements to support checkpoint-restart in userland (PTRACE_SEIZE
and friends) and had a half-working code.  At the time, Oleg was
against the idea and something else came up so I didn't push it all
the way but IIRC it didn't need to touch any arch code.  It should be
able to just share the existing trap path with ptrace.

Maybe Al sees something that I don't but AFAICS it should be doable in
generic code proper and I don't think it's gonna be that hard.

Oleg, are you still opposed to the idea of making freezer share trap
points with ptrace?

Thanks.
