While implementing that request, I thought about setting the auth size as part 
of the msg control in sendmsg instead of setsockopt. This would save us a 
system call and thus CPU cycles.

Thus may I propose that instead of using setsockopt,  ALG_SET_AEAD_AUTHSIZE 
should be added to af_alg_cmsg_send the same way as ALG_SET_AEAD_ASSOCLEN.

Along that line, wouldn't it make sense to get rid of the setsockopt in 
general and move even setting the key into the msg control and thus into 
af_alg_cmsg_send? I understand that this is a change to the user space API.

Thanks
