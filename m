Hi Tejun,

Can you please also update Documentation/block/cfq-iosched.txt and
Documentation/cgroup/blkio-controller.txt to reflect these new
changes.

So now we have tree modes?

- Orignal multi hierachy mode
- Multi hierarchy with sane flag
	- Sane flag modifies behavior of throttling.
- Unified hierarchy
	- Changes tunables.

Looks like some of the changes are related to sane flag and others
are related to unified hierarchy. Will it make sense to break it down
int two patches.

Agreed. Lets get rid of it.

Agreed. All this leaf_weight logic was little magic. Happy to see it go.

So now root cgroup will not have any cfq, weight[_device] knobs but
non root cgroups will have one? What's the harm in providing one for
root too for the sake of uniformity. That's a differnt thing thet root
does not have a competitor so value in that knob does not matter.

To me this knob is also for debugging purposes. CFQ divides disk time
proportionally. And if one wants to see how disk time is being divided
among cgroups, this knob helps. This is more to verify whether our
algorithm is working fine or not and if disk time is being divided
in proportion to weights or not.

But again, I am not particular about this knob. Sounds more like
debugging stuff.

io_queued shows number of IOs queued currently in cgroup. So this was
never supposed to be an accumulated value. Accumulated value will not
make sense here, I think.

Google folks wanted all these knobs. And they said that they have lot
of more knobs which they carry internally.

Personally I think io_queued might be a useful knob because it can
show current backlog on a particular cgroup and some tool might want
to dynamically monitor the queue lenghts of various cgroups and adjust
weights dynamically.

So this one might be worth retaining.

Makes sense. So this is more of a unified hierarchy related cleanup.

I am fine with this. Again Google folks intorduced those. Not sure
if they still use those. Less stats are better.

Looks good. This makes it consistent with blkio.throttle.* knobs.

throttling has correspnding knob as throttle.io_service_bytes. So either
we can change the name of throttling knob to throttle.bytes or
chnage keep this one as it is (cfq.io_service_bytes) for the sake of
consistency.

>   io_serviced_recursive		-> cfq.serviced

throttling layer uses throttle.io_serviced.

Given the fact that throttling layer counts bios and CFQ counts requests
may be we can keep throttle.bio_serviced  and cfq.rq_serviced as names.

Or may be just throttle.bios and cfq.requests respectively.

So this knob will not be user visible with unified hierarchy as well as with
sane behavior?

So this looks like a cleanup independent of unified hiearchy.

What't the harm in providing these knobs for root too?
