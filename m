Strange indeed. We have a shortcut to skip the charge if the task has
fatal_signals pending in __mem_cgroup_try_charge and
mem_cgroup_handle_oom. With a single task in the group it always calls
mem_cgroup_out_of_memory unless it is locked because of OOM from up the
hierarchy (but as you are able to echo to oom_control then this means
that you are under any hierarchy).

No OOM messages at all?

What are the steps to reproduce?

Interesting. This would mean that memcg_oom_recover woke up the task
from the wait queue and so it realizes it should die. This would suggest
a race when the task misses memcg_oom_recover resp. memcg_wakeup_oom but
that doesn't match with your single task in the group description or is
this just a final state and there were more tasks before OOM happened?

mem_cgroup_iter could be part of mem_cgroup_{,un}mark_under_oom

I am confused now mem_cgroup_handle_oom doesn't call
__mem_cgroup_try_charge or have I just misunderstood what you are
saying?

Shouldn't schedule take care of the pending singnals on its own and keep
the task on the runqueue?

Ahh, OK, so you are having memcg OOM disabled and a manager sits on the
eventfd and sending SIGKILL to a task, right?

OK, I guess this answers the most of my questions above.

Isn't this a bug in freezer then? I am not familiar with the freezer
much but memcg oom handling seems correct to me. The task is sleeping
KILLABLE and fatal_signal_pending in mem_cgroup_handle_oom will tell us
to bypass the charge and let the taks go away.

Tejun?
