+AD4- +AD4- I really think that if we want to make progress on this one, we need
+AD4- +AD4- code and someone that owns it.  Nick's work was impressive, but it was
+AD4- +AD4- mostly there for getting rid of buffer heads.  If we have a device that
+AD4- +AD4- needs it and someone working to enable that device, we'll go forward
+AD4- +AD4- much faster.

+AD4- Do we even need to do that (eliminate buffer heads)?  We cope with 4k
+AD4- sector only devices just fine today because the bh mechanisms now
+AD4- operate on top of the page cache and can do the RMW necessary to update
+AD4- a bh in the page cache itself which allows us to do only 4k chunked
+AD4- writes, so we could keep the bh system and just alter the granularity of
+AD4- the page cache.
+AD4- 

We're likely to have people mixing 4K drives and +ADw-fill in some other
size here+AD4- on the same box.  We could just go with the biggest size and
use the existing bh code for the sub-pagesized blocks, but I really
hesitate to change VM fundamentals for this.

>From a pure code point of view, it may be less work to change it once in
the VM.  But from an overall system impact point of view, it's a big
change in how the system behaves just for filesystem metadata.

+AD4- The other question is if the drive does RMW between 4k and whatever its
+AD4- physical sector size, do we need to do anything to take advantage of
+AD4- it ... as in what would altering the granularity of the page cache buy
+AD4- us?

The real benefit is when and how the reads get scheduled.  We're able to
do a much better job pipelining the reads, controlling our caches and
reducing write latency by having the reads done up in the OS instead of
the drive.
