Odd. In 3.12 xHCI has dynamic debugging, and turning on CONFIG_USB_DEBUG
should turn on debugging by default, so it's confusing that you didn't
see any messages.

Can I see your .config from /boot/?  Also, did you try capturing dmesg
with `tail -f /var/log/kern.log` or just dmesg?  Perhaps you need to run
`sudo dmesg -n 7`?

Yes, you did.  So perhaps the patch triggers a different bug.  I can't
tell until I see xHCI debugging output.

Thanks for your patience. :)
