Great, then you don't need this, no need to worry about it at all, why
are we having this conversation? :)

It's a totally different model, as you point out from what you are
thinking of "traditional" IPC methods (side note, which of the 15+
current IPC methods do you consider "traditional", we have a lot of them
these days...)

Why not?  :)

Seriously, they are related in a way, see my long blog post for all of
the details about it if you are curious.

People compare them a lot, which is why I brought it up, it's a
discussion that needed to be made.

It's not my "goal" to sell kdbus to you, if you don't want it, great,
don't worry about it, don't build it on your kernels, and the world will
be fine.  Consider it like any other "driver" or filesystem, if you
don't need it, there's nothing to even discuss.

But odds are, you are using a system with D-Bus today, if not, then you
are using Linux in a very specific and limited manner, which is
wonderful, in that case this whole thread isn't really pertinent.

Lots of people do use D-Bus, and for those users, that is what this
patchset is for.

Hope that helps clear things up,
