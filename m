That was in particular with respect to /dev/mem.

In the general case calling setuid or any of it's cousins can cause the
same problem.  So a revoke that only works at exec time is insufficient.

The problem we are examining is what happens when the file descriptor is
passed to a more privileged process that will pass the ptrace_may_access
check while the original process that opened the file did not.

We have file->f_cred that has the permissions of the process at open
time, and likely that should factor into the calculations somehow.

Alternatively we may simply be able to call get_task_cred() at the time
we open the file and if the cred on the process changes fail.  I know
Linus was looking at something like that recently, but ran into problmes
with Chromes sandbox. (Sigh).  Although I think he was talking about
file->f_cred...

This is most definitely a solvable problem with current mechanisms, but
it is going to take some grunt work to make it happen.
