Thanks!

I don't think futex() ever was in glibc--that's by design, and
completely understandable: no user-space application would want to
directly use futex(). (BTW, I mispoke in my earlier mail when I said I
wanted documentation suitable for "writers of library functions" -- I
meant suitable for "writers of *C library*".)

We should keep the man page ;-). I just need to add some words to
point out the use of syscall(). Mostly though, I'm interested in
getting documentation of the operations listed below :-).

Cheers,

Michael
