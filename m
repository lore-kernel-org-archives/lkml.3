I think you mean cifsFileInfo instead of cifsInodeInfo above, but that
otherwise makes sense.

Mateusz, for future reference it's best to inline the patches in an
email instead of attaching them like this, since it makes it easier to
comment on them. You should also send them with a proper description at
the head and a Signed-off-by line.

One minor nit inline below...

The thing we have to be careful about here is whether we could ever
race with the atomic_dec_and_test in deactivate_locked_super. We should
only be creating a new cifsFileInfo in the context of an open-type
syscall, so bumping the s_active count unconditionally there should be
since we'll implicitly hold a reference to the vfsmount.

It might be worth a comment on cifs_sb_active to that effect though to
make sure no one makes that mistake in the future.

Other than the need for a comment there, this looks good to me. Nice
work. When you respin and resend, you can add:
