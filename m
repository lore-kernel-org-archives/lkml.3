For procfs yes, read() time checks are unrobust, the general agreement on
procfs is checks should be performed during each syscall.

For the locking on read()/write() IMHO there should be locking by design
for /proc/pid/* entries. Here we are speaking about content that varies,
data attached to other processes, so there is already some locking
mechanism, and for sensitive stuff, we must hold the cred mutex. This
is the standard from the old days of procfs.


And yes some of them are racy, but we can improve it, delay the checks.

I agree, but those access should also be checked at the beginning, IOW
during ->open(). revoke will not help if revoke is not involved at all,
the task /proc entries may still be valide (no execve).

Currently security boundary is crossed for example arbitrary /proc/*/stack
(and others).
1) The target task does not do an execve (no revoke).
2) current task will open these files and *want* and *will* pass the fd to a
more privileged process to pass the ptrace check which is done only during
->read().

Hmm, These two are related? can't get rid of permission checks
especially on this pseudofilesystem!

Of course, I did clean the patchset to prove that it will work, and I
only implemented full protection for /proc/*/{stack,syscall,stat} other
files will wait.

But Ingo you can't ignore the fact that:
/proc/*/{stack,syscall} are 0444 mode
/proc/*/{stack,syscall} do not have ptrace_may_access() during open()
/proc/*/{stack,syscall} have the ptrace_may_access() during read()

Every unprivileged process will have an fd on arbitrary privileged
files, then pass fd to a more privileged process...
https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/8/28/544

We need 0400 VFS checks, and ptrace capability check during ->open().


So here revoke is not invloved at all, we'll have to close these issues.
Any thoughts please ? patch submitted but... I can split it again to
try to close these issues. Then wait to see for the file->f_cred or revoke
design ?
