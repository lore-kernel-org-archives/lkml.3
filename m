Hi Hannes,

We only tested the later patch which returns _TARGET_PRESENT after
parsing sense, it works as expected.

About the cause of this issue, admin said he is configuring a
active-active cluster mode storage. Each node has it own LUN pool and a
set of rule to control which node can access the pool.
LUN7 is owned and can only be able to manipulated by the other node, but
can be seen by this node for a misconfig. So it presents itself in
REPORT_LUN but return NOT_READY when accessed through this node.
Do you still regard this as a misbehave in response to INQUIRY?

Thanks,
Vaughan
