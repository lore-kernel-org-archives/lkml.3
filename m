On the topic that we do a fast return for both scsi and ata. Now I
don't remember everything about this (and correct me if I'm wrong)
since I figured this out a few months ago.

There are some dependencies that scsi has on the resume path of ata. I
think it's that before we can send the command to spin up the disk, we
need to wait for the ata host controller to come up. As Aaron Lu
pointed out, it takes seconds for the ata port to resume. On the hand,
the resume for sd needs to wait for this to complete, so even if we
return early for ata, but not the scsi disk, suddenly it will be the
scsi disk that takes 2-5 seconds to resume.
