Well, it's an input into the lm_grant callback, but it originally comes
in the downcall from userland (AFAICT). In this case, I'm referring to
the field in the downcall.

It's been a while since I've looked over the lockd code, but I believe
it's just a flag that indicates whether there is still a conflict
between the block and the lock on the file.

I don't think that patch will break anything. I just don't see it as an
improvement on what's already there.

The rationale for this is lost in antiquity, but I think the basic idea
was that you're either granting or updating the block based on the
_result_ from some check for a lock conflict. While "result" as a name
is a little confusing, "type" is even more so, IMO.

If you're hell-bent on changing this, then my suggestion would be
to turn it into a bool and call it "conflict" or something similar. If
you do decide to do that, adding some helpful kerneldoc comments would
be a nice improvement too.
