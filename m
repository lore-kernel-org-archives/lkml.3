Yeah, that's true.  On the other hand, all the constants that are
missing are really just for userspace tools in general.

I'd guesstimate 40-50.

Yes, like "/* 0x00 */ CONSTANT, MASK".  I still have a slight preference
for the opcodes because if the constant ends up wrong, the
head-scratching would be higher than if the opcode is wrong (the opcode
is what you see in the dumps).

Ok, // comments replaced with C comments.

No, they are not, but it is fine anyway. :)  You'll really use very
little of this table (and of the old one as well) in the hot paths.

No, the queue just stores the device type in an unsigned char.  The
device type is then used to pick a bit in each word.  I think you are
confusing with an earlier version you saw on Red Hat mailing lists, but
you NACKed it because you didn't like the lazy allocation.
