I can make it to be time-based. Still we need some kind of magic number 
of ns of spinning before we give up. Also, it will make the code more 
complicated. Now I am thinking about reduce the threshold to a small 
number, say 16, in addition to whether the sem count is changing to 
decide when to give up. Hopefully, that will reduce the number of 
useless spinning when the readers are running.

Overloading pointers with some kind of special value is a technique that 
is also used elsewhere in the kernel.

Well, this kind of fixed threshold spinning is actually used in the 
para-virtualized spinlock. Please see the SPIN_THRESHOLD macro in 
arch/x86/include/asm/spinlock.h for more details.

When the lock is writer-owned, the only overhead is an additional check 
for (owner == RWSEM_READ_OWNED) which should be negligible compared to 
reading the contended semaphore cacheline. I don't think that it will 
have any performance impact in this case.
