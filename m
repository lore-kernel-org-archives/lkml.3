Dave,

You are right. The comment does need to be updated. It is safe though to 
change it to void *. I have verified this field is used by the lower 
layer SCCB manager (not fw) and the upper layer buslogic driver only. 
This field does get used to store 64-bit memory pointers as well as 
32-bit DMA pointers depending upon the operation specified in 
blogic_ccb, and I have made sure the usage is consistent between the two 
layers.

I can correct the comments in another patch if that is ok by James.
