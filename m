I don't think so.

I don't fully understand BDI_CAP_STRICTLIMIT, but it seems to be very
fuse-specific and relates to NR_WRITEBACK_TEMP, which only fuse uses.  NFS
doesn't need any 'strict' limits.
i.e. it looks like fuse-specific code inside core-vm code, which I would
rather steer clear of.

Setting a bdi flag for a loopback-mounted NFS filesystem isn't really
possible because it "is it loopback mounted" state is fluid.  IP addresses =
can
be migrated (for HA cluster failover) and what was originally a remote-NFS
mount can become a loopback NFS mount (and that is exactly the case I need =
to
deal with).

So we can only really assess "is it loop-back" on a per-request basis.

This patch does that assessment in nfsd to limit the use of PF_LESS_THROTTL=
E.
Another patch does it in nfs to limit the waiting in nfs_release_page.

Thanks,
NeilBrown
