Nice idea.

Yes, I think "copy" and "reflink" needs to be differentiated.

Can filesystem support "whole file copy" only?  Or arbitrary
block-to-block copy should be mandatory?

Splice has size_t argument for the size, which is limited to 4G on 32
bit.  Won't this be an issue for whole-file-copy?  We could have
special value (-1) for whole file, but that's starting to be hackish.

We are talking about copying large amounts of data in a single
syscall, which will possibly take a long time.  Will the syscall be
interruptible?  Restartable?

Thanks,
Miklos
