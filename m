Sorry for long delay. It was long holidays.

No, I haven't consider it. It sounds good idea to place the pages in a
CMA region into a separate zone. Perhaps we can remove one of
migratetype, MIGRATE_CMA, with this way and it would be a good long-term
architecture for CMA.

I don't know exact history and reason why CMA is implemented in current
form. Ccing some experts in this area.

Thanks.
