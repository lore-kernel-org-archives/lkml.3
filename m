10% is not very large gain given the complexity it adds, and I
question that the gain actually comes from moving the memcpy() into
the kernel.  If this recvfile code enabled zero-copy behaviour into
the page cache, then it would be worth pursuing. But it doesn't, and
so IMO the complexity is not worth the gain right now.

Indeed, I suspect the 10% gain will be from the multi-page write
behaviour that was hacked into the code. I wrote a multi-page
write prototype ~3 years ago that showed write(2) performance gains
of roughly 10% on low CPU power machines running XFS.

$ git branch |grep multi
  multipage-write
$ git checkout multipage-write 
Checking out files: 100% (45114/45114), done.
Switched to branch 'multipage-write'
$ head -4 Makefile 
VERSION = 2
PATCHLEVEL = 6
SUBLEVEL = 37
EXTRAVERSION = -rc6
$

I should probably pick this up again and push it forwards. FWIW,
I've attached the first multipage-write infrastructure patch from
the above branch to show how this sort of operation needs to be done
from a filesystem and page-cache perspective to avoid locking
problems have sane error handling.

I beleive the version that Christoph implemented for a couple of
OEMs around that time de-multiplexed the ->iomap method....

Cheers,

Dave.

multipage-write: introduce iomap infrastructure

From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

Add infrastructure for multipage writes by defining the mapping interface
that the multipage writes will use and the main multipage write loop.
