I understood correctly then. :)  I agree it's not the best, but it's not
completely broken either.  It has bugs, and that's what these patches
try to fix.

No, it wouldn't.  I learnt it the hard way (by having a patch nacked :))
at http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1311887.

Polkit need not do anything to give out the access rights, it only has
to just confirm the credentials.  A helper setgid-disk can consult
polkit, open the file, pass the file descriptor back, and exit.  We
already do something similar for tap devices.

Exactly.  Though these commands do not really affect other devices
sharing the bus, they affect other initiators trying to use the device.
 And these commands are generic, so they apply to disks as well as tapes.

Unfortunately, a purely userspace whitelist would be too easy to circumvent.

Yes, I understand that.  But I don't believe it is a serious concern.
In the case of tapes, for example, you're not talking about 10 dollar
USB pendrives whose firmware was written in fire-and-forget mode.
Firmware bugs would be updated by the manufacturers.

I cannot exclude there will _never_ be a bug like this, of course.  But
even if there will be one, IMHO it would be exceptional enough that we
can afford fixing it with a per-device quirk.

Scanners have never had any CDB filtering done on them; I searched for
this kind of bug, and I couldn't find any report.

What I am trying to do is to reach a compromise.  The one I'm proposing
is to forbid reserved or vendor-specific commands, while at the same
time opening the doors on more standardized commands.
