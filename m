I think the 'toopen' is a bad choice.  I'm having trouble wrapping my
head around the semantics of this variable, your description feels a
bit handwavy, the main noun is missing in the command above, I think I
found one more overflow bug,...

What you ended up doing is reimplement a rw_semaphone.  Why not use
one instead?  down_write() for exclusive access, down_read() for
non-exclusive, _trylock variants for nonblocking opens, etc.

Would this work?
