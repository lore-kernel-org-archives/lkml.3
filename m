No, the kernel uses them for a lot more than that. Pretty much all of
the keys API upcalls use it. See all of the callers of
call_usermodehelper. All of them are running user binaries out of the
kernel, and almost all of them are certainly broken wrt containers.

Suppose I spawn my own container as a user, using all of this spiffy
new user namespace stuff. Then I make the kernel use
call_usermodehelper to call the upcall in the init_ns, and then trick
it into running my new "escape_from_namespace" program with "real" root
privileges.

I don't think we can reasonably assume that having the kernel exec an
arbitrary binary inside of a container is safe. Doing so inside of the
init_ns is marginally more safe, but only marginally so...

Nothing _forces_ us to do so, but upcalls are very difficult to handle,
and UMH has a lot of advantages over a long-running daemon launched by
userland.

Originally, I created the nfsdcltrack upcall as a running daemon called
nfsdcld, and the kernel used rpc_pipefs to communicate with it.

Everyone hated it because no one likes to have to run daemons for
infrequently used upcalls. It's a pain for users to ensure that it's
running and it's a pain to handle when it isn't. So, I was encouraged
to turn that instead into a UMH upcall.

But leaving that aside, this problem is a lot larger than just nfsd. We
have a *lot* of UMH upcalls in the kernel, so this problem is more
general than just "fixing" nfsd's.
