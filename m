As opposed to what, "permanent" OOM conditions? :-) I'm running out of
ways to phrase this...  The sampling window for OOM conditions is
completely arbitrary.  Right now it spans 5 reclaim cycles.  Adding a
last-second check for a random event right before the kill adds
nothing but noise.

If the sampling window is too small for you, then increase the number
of reclaim cycles as I proposed earlier.  It does exactly the same
thing but it's less invasive:

diff --git a/mm/memcontrol.c b/mm/memcontrol.c
index 13b9d0f..6d308ed 100644

Or just wait for every single task in the memcg to be stuck in the
charge path, then you know for sure that the OOM condition is
permanent.  Unless an external task kills one of them, of course...

Thanks.
