Special casing pread() behavior for signalfd() so that SFD_RAW is not
required seems only to make the ugliness worse...

While I appreciate the need for this API, multiplexing a queue
selector and a positional value into what is normally a byte offset in
pread() is really bizarre. This is ugly and I wonder if something
better is possible, though so far I have no suggestions beyond adding
a new system call.
