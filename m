I did not understand this point. In flat model, application issuing
at configured page will not get penalized.

This penalty is coming from the fact that we are moving bios after the
wait and make them wait in another queue.

In flat model there is no such problem. So to me, it is the problem
of how hierarchical scheduling is implemented. In flat model, I did
not have to deal with it.

Ok. Not having a perfect algorithm now is fine. We can always redo it
later.
