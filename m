I’m wondering what should be done about NFS. A solution for NFS should
match any scheme that is considered for local file systems, IMO.

NFSv2/3 timestamps are a pair of unsigned 32-bit values: one value for
seconds since midnight GMT Jan 1, 1970, and one value for nanoseconds.
(See the definition of nfstime3 in RFC 1813).

NFSv4 uses a signed 64-bit value where zero represents midnight UTC
on January 1, 1970, and an unsigned 32-bit value for nanoseconds. (See
the definition of nfstime4 in RFC 5661).

The NFSv4 protocol is probably not problematic, and NFSv3 should be out
of the picture by 2038. But if changes are planned for dealing _now_
with timestamp issues, compatibility with NFSv3 is a consideration.

It is already the case that, via NFSv3, the Linux NFS client transmits
timestamps earlier than 1970 as large positive numbers. Try this with
xfstests generic/258.

Maybe nfs3_proc_setattr() should recognize pre-epoch timestamps and
timestamps larger than can be represented in an unsigned 32-bit field
and return an immediate error to the requesting application (like EINVAL).

If the Linux NFS server encounters a local file with a timestamp that
cannot be represented via a u32, should it also return NFS3ERR_INVAL?

RFC 1813 does not provide guidance on the behavior nor does it suggest
a particular error status code. The Solaris 11 server appears to return
NFS3ERR_INVAL in this case.

An alternative would be to “cap” the timestamps transmitted via NFSv3 by
Linux, so that a pre-epoch timestamp is transmitted as zero, and a large
timestamp is transmitted as UINT_MAX.
