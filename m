Hi Ben,

I looked at this some more.   It seems like my v2 backport may be the
most suitable for the releases mentioned in the subject line, but I'd
like to get additional feedback.

The lines added by commit a5065eb just get removed by commit b7a77235. 
Also, if I apply commit a5065eb, it will also require a backport to pull
in just a piece of code(Remove snd_printk() and add dev_dbg()) from
another prior commit(0ba41d9).  No backport would be needed at all if I
cherry-pick 0ba41d9, but that commit seems to have too may changes for a
stable release.

Thanks,

Joe
