Yes, it has already been agreed on that open() time is the correct place to
do the check, and that either the check value should be cached in the
struct seq_file or the struct cred/file should be kept so that the check
can be done later. I think caching the result is actually better since it
removes the whole in_irq() problem also.

The problem I have at the moment is handling the case for 
/sys/module<modname>/sections/*, which are seq_files in Greg's
driver-core tree, but do not actually pass the struct seq_file to the show
function, which makes it impossible to check what the open() time
permissions were.

Again, this has already been agreed on. As suggested by George I have
a function called seq_kernel_pointer(), which returns either the real
pointer or NULL based on the cached check at seq_open(), so you do
prints like:

  seq_printf(seq, "secret value = %p\n", seq_kernel_pointer(seq, ptr));

Once I figure out how to resolve the module sections case, I will post
a patch series.
