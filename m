As there were follow up fixed on top of this one I have squashed them
into the following one (changelogs preserved) for review. I hope I
haven't missed any patch. I will respond to this email with the review
comments. It is quite large so it will take some time...

Subject: [PATCH] mm: memcontrol: rewrite uncharge API

The memcg uncharging code that is involved towards the end of a page's
lifetime - truncation, reclaim, swapout, migration - is impressively
complicated and fragile.

Because anonymous and file pages were always charged before they had their
page->mapping established, uncharges had to happen when the page type
could still be known from the context; as in unmap for anonymous, page
cache removal for file and shmem pages, and swap cache truncation for swap
pages.  However, these operations happen well before the page is actually
freed, and so a lot of synchronization is necessary:

- Charging, uncharging, page migration, and charge migration all need
  to take a per-page bit spinlock as they could race with uncharging.

- Swap cache truncation happens during both swap-in and swap-out, and
  possibly repeatedly before the page is actually freed.  This means
  that the memcg swapout code is called from many contexts that make
  no sense and it has to figure out the direction from page state to
  make sure memory and memory+swap are always correctly charged.

- On page migration, the old page might be unmapped but then reused,
  so memcg code has to prevent untimely uncharging in that case.
  Because this code - which should be a simple charge transfer - is so
  special-cased, it is not reusable for replace_page_cache().

But now that charged pages always have a page->mapping, introduce
mem_cgroup_uncharge(), which is called after the final put_page(), when we
know for sure that nobody is looking at the page anymore.

For page migration, introduce mem_cgroup_migrate(), which is called after
the migration is successful and the new page is fully rmapped.  Because
the old page is no longer uncharged after migration, prevent double
charges by decoupling the page's memcg association (PCG_USED and
pc->mem_cgroup) from the page holding an actual charge.  The new bits
PCG_MEM and PCG_MEMSW represent the respective charges and are transferred
to the new page during migration.

mem_cgroup_migrate() is suitable for replace_page_cache() as well, which
gets rid of mem_cgroup_replace_page_cache().

Swap accounting is massively simplified: because the page is no longer
uncharged as early as swap cache deletion, a new mem_cgroup_swapout() can
transfer the page's memory+swap charge (PCG_MEMSW) to the swap entry
before the final put_page() in page reclaim.

Finally, page_cgroup changes are now protected by whatever protection the
page itself offers: anonymous pages are charged under the page table lock,
whereas page cache insertions, swapin, and migration hold the page lock.
Uncharging happens under full exclusion with no outstanding references.
Charging and uncharging also ensure that the page is off-LRU, which
serializes against charge migration.  Remove the very costly page_cgroup
lock and set pc->flags non-atomically.

mm: memcontrol: rewrite uncharge API fix 2

It's not entirely clear whether do_swap_account or PCG_MEMSW is the
authoritative answer to whether a page is swap-accounted or not.  This
currently leads to the following memsw counter underflow when swap
accounting is disabled:

Don't set PCG_MEMSW when swap accounting is disabled, so that uncharging
only has to look at this per-page flag.

mem_cgroup_swapout() could also fully rely on this flag, but as it can
bail out before even looking up the page_cgroup, check do_swap_account as
a performance optimization and only sanity test for PCG_MEMSW.

The soft limit tree lock needs to be IRQ-safe as it's acquired while
holding the IRQ-safe zone->lru_lock.

But more importantly, with uncharge happening in release_pages() now,
this path is executed from interrupt context.

Make the soft limit tree lock, uncharge batching, and charge
statistics IRQ-safe.

mem_cgroup_migrate() assumes that a page is only migrated once and
then freed immediately after.

However, putting the page back on the LRU list and dropping the
isolation refcount is not done atomically.  This allows a PFN-based
migrator like compaction to isolate the page, see the expected
anonymous page refcount of 1, and migrate the page once more.

Catch pages that have already been migrated and abort migration
gracefully.

 7. Page Migration
-   	One of the most complicated functions is page-migration-handler.
-	Memcg has 2 routines. Assume that we are migrating a page's contents
-	from OLDPAGE to NEWPAGE.
-
-	Usual migration logic is..
-	(a) remove the page from LRU.
-	(b) allocate NEWPAGE (migration target)
-	(c) lock by lock_page().
-	(d) unmap all mappings.
-	(e-1) If necessary, replace entry in radix-tree.
-	(e-2) move contents of a page.
-	(f) map all mappings again.
-	(g) pushback the page to LRU.
-	(-) OLDPAGE will be freed.
-
-	Before (g), memcg should complete all necessary charge/uncharge to
-	NEWPAGE/OLDPAGE.
-
-	The point is....
-	- If OLDPAGE is anonymous, all charges will be dropped at (d) because
-          try_to_unmap() drops all mapcount and the page will not be
-	  SwapCache.
-
-	- If OLDPAGE is SwapCache, charges will be kept at (g) because
-	  __delete_from_swap_cache() isn't called at (e-1)
-
-	- If OLDPAGE is page-cache, charges will be kept at (g) because
-	  remove_from_swap_cache() isn't called at (e-1)
-
-	memcg provides following hooks.
-
-	- mem_cgroup_prepare_migration(OLDPAGE)
-	  Called after (b) to account a charge (usage += PAGE_SIZE) against
-	  memcg which OLDPAGE belongs to.
-
-        - mem_cgroup_end_migration(OLDPAGE, NEWPAGE)
-	  Called after (f) before (g).
-	  If OLDPAGE is used, commit OLDPAGE again. If OLDPAGE is already
-	  charged, a charge by prepare_migration() is automatically canceled.
-	  If NEWPAGE is used, commit NEWPAGE and uncharge OLDPAGE.
-
-	  But zap_pte() (by exit or munmap) can be called while migration,
-	  we have to check if OLDPAGE/NEWPAGE is a valid page after commit().
