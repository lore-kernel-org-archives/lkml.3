Actually there is more to it, as I just found upon reading the code
again (I had noticed it before when I first looked at the driver but
then forgotten about it):

ips_fix_ffdc_time() needs the correct current wall-clock time, no overflow
allowed, to stick the year/month/day/hour/minute/second value into
the ffdc command.

My comment to Ebru about ktime_get_ts64 for monotonic time was unfortunately
completely wrong, since that would break whatever timekeeping it is
in the hardware that wants the correct year/month/day/hour/minute/second
values.

The part I'm interested in is getting rid of any mention of time_t,
timespec and timeval in the kernel by replacing each use with something
that is known to be y2038-safe. Using jiffies correctly would solve
a number of them, but is not sufficient for this driver because of the
ffdc command.

We could use jiffies to test whether we need to send ffdc but then
we still need to read the correct time.

It's not a system call, all we need is a simple function call that reads
tk->xtime_sec. We can use get_seconds() today, but it returns an
'unsigned long', so that won't be enough on 32-bit architectures.

It's still slightly more expensive to do the function call and use a 64-bit
number on a 32-bit CPU, but it's not on the scale of doing a system call
here. You can probably judge best if it's worth the increase in complexity
to use jiffies for determining whether to send the update and then
use get_seconds64 (or similar) to read the wall-clock time, or whether
always using get_seconds64 would be good enough.
