I'm not pulling this. Passing in TASK_RUNNING to prepare_to_wait() is
insane (because if it ever were to actually wait, that would be a
bug), and afaik this would be the first time anybody ever does that.

Yes, yes, it may "work", but I'm not pulling that kind of hack just
before a release.

Quite frankly, it looks like you want to have a tristate argument ("no
wait", "wait interruptibly", "wait uninterruptibly") to that
percpu_ida_alloc() function. Fine. But dammit, using this kind of
hackery, and then having two *different* calling conventions (one
mis-using the gfp_t for legacy reasons, and one now using the task
state flags in odd ways) is just not acceptable.

Now, neither of those two is perfect, but I can see why you want to
use the task state ones to say which kind of interruptible you want..
But I really don't like suddenly having a
prepare_to_wait(TASK_RUNNING) caller without any discussion, and I
*really* don't like having two completely different models for this
hack.

So quite frankly, I'd much prefer:

 - talk to the scheduler people, and make them aware of the fact that
you are going to pass in TASK_RUNNING to prepare_to_wait(). It works
with the code as-is, as long as you don't actually then wait.

 - Don't do that wrapper function with a totally different calling
convention logic. Instead, just change all the callers explicitly.
>From a quick look, you really only have a couple of cases:

  (a) target/iscsi, which wants the new ternary argument

  (b) vhost/scsi.c, which uses GFP_ATOMIC and can be changed to TASK_RUNNABLE

  (c) block/blk-mq-tag.c, which already hates the current insane
thing, and uses __GFP_WAIT and (gfp & ~__GFP_WAIT) and other hacks,
and is obviously *very* aware of the internal hackery in the current
percpu_ida_alloc() argument. So I'm getting the feeling that that
whole thing might actually be *happier* with the TASK_xyz flags.

So I really think this needs cleanup, and that hacky "passing in
TASK_RUNNING to prepare_to_wait()" needs to be made official. And yes,
that implies that it's too late to try to push this through for 3.13,
this goes into the next merge window and can be backported.

Added the appropriate people to the Cc..
