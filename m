Hello, Neil, Jeff.

@max_active is a per-pool number.  By default, unbound wqs use
per-node pools, so @max_active would be per-node.  Currently,
@max_active is mostly meant as a protection against run-away
workqueues creating crazy number of workers, which has been enough for
the existing wq users.  *Maybe* it makes sense to make it actually
mean maximum concurrency which would prolly involve aggregated per-cpu
distribution mechanism so that we don't end up inc'ing and dec'ing the
same counter from all CPUs on each work item execution.

However, I do agree with Neil that making it user configurable is
almost always painful.  It's usually a question without a good answer
and the same value may behave differently depending on a lot of
implementation details and a better approach, probably, is to use
@max_active as the last resort protection mechanism while providing
automatic throttling of in-flight work items which is meaningful for
the specific use cases.

Definitely, there were some reportings but nothing really got tracked
down properly.  It'd be awesome to actually find out where the latency
is coming from.

Thanks!
