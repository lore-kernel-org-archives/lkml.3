After checking both kernel and btrfs-progs, it seems file offset is only being
passed through TLV(see send.c/ send_write/
TLV_PUT_U64(BTRFS_SEND_A_FILE_OFFSET). Tell me if I'm wrong but when we do
'btrfs send backup  | btrfs receive backupvolume',
btrfs-progs calls btrfs_ioctl_send emitting several BTRFS_SEND_C_WRITE with
relevant BTRFS_SEND_A_FILE_OFFSET (growing by 48kb). At the other side of | ,
'btrfs receive' executes read_and_process_cmd which does TLV_GET before
s->ops->write. All btrfs interactions being done with | maybe we could simply
replace vfs_write stuff as you suggested and remove sctx->send_off ?
