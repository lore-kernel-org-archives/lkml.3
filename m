So I guess the question is what, if any, permission checks performed by
the vfs helpers are appropriate and desired when called by overlayfs,
and which ones should be always-allowed/skipped.  Normally in this kind
of situation we'd either switch to a special credential set up to allow
the desired set of permissions or we'd use vfs helpers that skip the
usual permission checks.  For the former, we not only need to change
cap_effective but also the SELinux context/SID in order to both allow
the desired capabilities and to allow the desired file accesses without
needing to directly allow them to the current process' context/SID.  At
which point you would need to replicate in overlayfs whichever checks
should be performed on the original credentials.
