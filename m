As I understand it the original idea was that cold data really could
take multiple seconds or minutes to retrieve (because e.g. a tape
library might need to go load the right tape and rewind to the right
spot...).  Is that sort of system really used much these days?

My position is that we simply have no idea what order of magnitude even
delay should be.  And that in such a situation exponential backoff such
as implemented in the synchronous case seems the reasonable default as
it guarantees at worst doubling the delay while still bounding the
long-term average frequency of retries.
