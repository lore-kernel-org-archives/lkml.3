+AEAD cipher API
+===============
+
+The operation is identical to the symmetric cipher API. However, an AEAD
+cipher requires additional information, such as the authentication tag and
+the associated data. This data is to be supplied in addition to the normal
+symmetric cipher data like key and IV discussed for the symmetric ciphers.
+
+During initialization, the struct sockaddr data structure must be filled as
+follows:
+
+struct sockaddr_alg sa = {
+	.salg_family = AF_ALG,
+	.salg_type = "aead", /* this selects the AEAD cipher */
+	.salg_name = "gcm(aes)" /* this is the cipher name */
+};
+
+The discussion about the sendmsg given for the symmetric cipher applies for
+the AEAD interface as well. In addition to the plaintext / ciphertext data and
+the IV, the following data must be supplied with the cmsghdr data structure:
+
+	* The AEAD authentication tag size is set with the flag
+	  ALG_SET_AEAD_AUTHSIZE. The integer value of the authentication tag
+	  size must be provided in the data field of the cmsghdr structure.
+
+	* The AEAD associated data is set with the flag ALG_SET_AEAD_ASSOC.
+	  The data is set the same way as for the IV by supplying the associated
+	  data in the data field of the cmsghdr structure.
+
+The authentication tag itself, however, is handled in a different way to comply
+with the specifics of the kernel crypto API and to avoid copying the
+authentication tag around in memory. The authentication tag is added to the
+memory that immediately follows the ciphertext.
+
+	* When performing an encryption operation, the resulting ciphertext
+	  buffer will hold the tag as follows: ciphertext || tag.  The consumer
+	  must ensure that the ciphertext buffer is large enough to hold the
+	  ciphertext together with the tag of the size set by the consumer using
+	  the ALG_SET_AEAD_AUTHSIZE cmsghdr flag as discussed above.
+
+	* When performing a decryption operation, the initial ciphertext buffer
+	  must hold the tag as follows: ciphertext || tag. The resulting
+	  plaintext has the same size as the ciphertext.
+
+Note: Authentication errors during decryption are marked with a failing
+read/recv system call whose errno is set to EBADMSG.
+
+
+Random number generator API
+===========================
+
+Compared to the symmetric ciphers, the random number generator API is simple:
+it only supports the system calls of read/recv.
+
+The consumer must observe the returned size of the read/recv system calls and
+potentially make subsequent calls if the returned length of random numbers is
+smaller than the expected length.
+
+When initializing a random number generator instance, the AF_ALG interface
+handler ensures that it is appropriately seeded.
