blk_rq_map_kern() -> blk_rq_append_bio() -> blk_rq_bio_prep() is what
does the request setup from the bios returned by bio_[copy,map]_kern()
in blk_rq_map_kern() code.

blk_queue_bounce() is called immediately after blk_rq_append_bio() here,
which AFAICT looks like it's doing the correct thing for scsi-mq..

What is strange here is that libata-scsi.c CDB emulation code is doing
the same stuff for both INQUIRY (that seems to be OK) and READ_CAPACITY
(that is returning zeros), which makes me think that something else is
going on..

Alexander, where you able to re-test using sdev->sdev_mq_reg.queue_depth
= 1 in scsi_mq_alloc_queue()..?
