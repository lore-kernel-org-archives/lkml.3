Hello, Linus.

* Fixes and a lot of cleanups.  Locking cleanup is finally complete.
  cgroup_mutex is no longer exposed to individual controlelrs which
  used to cause nasty deadlock issues.  Li fixed and cleaned up quite
  a bit including long standing ones like racy cgroup_path().

* device cgroup now supports proper hierarchy thanks to Aristeu.

* perf_event cgroup now supports proper hierarchy.

* A new mount option "__DEVEL__sane_behavior" is added.  As indicated
  by the name, this option is to be used for development only at this
  point and generates a warning message when used.  Unfortunately,
  cgroup interface currently has too many brekages and inconsistencies
  to implement a consistent and unified hierarchy on top.  The new
  flag is used to collect the behavior changes which are necessary to
  implement consistent unified hierarchy.  It's likely that this flag
  won't be used verbatim when it becomes ready but will be enabled
  implicitly along with unified hierarchy.

  The option currently disables some of broken behaviors in cgroup
  core and also .use_hierarchy switch in memcg (will be routed through
  -mm), which can be used to make very unusual hierarchy where nesting
  is partially honored.  It will also be used to implement hierarchy
  support for blk-throttle which would be impossible otherwise without
  introducing a full separate set of control knobs.

  This is essentially versioning of interface which isn't very nice
  but at this point I can't see any other options which would allow
  keeping the interface the same while moving towards hierarchy
  behavior which is at least somewhat sane.  The planned unified
  hierarchy is likely to require some level of adaptation from
  userland anyway, so I think it'd be best to take the chance and
  update the interface such that it's supportable in the long term.

  Maintaining the existing interface does complicate cgroup core but
  shouldn't put too much strain on individual controllers and I think
  it'd be manageable for the foreseeable future.  Maybe we'll be able
  to drop it in a decade.

This pull request creates the following trivial conflict in
include/linux/res_counter.h

  <<<<<<< HEAD
  #include <linux/cgroup.h>
  #include <linux/errno.h>
  =======
  #include <linux/spinlock.h>
  >>>>>>> 2a0010af17b1739ef8ea8cf02647a127241ee674

The conflict is between the following two commits.

* ebf47beb6 ("include/linux/res_counter.h needs errno.h") added
  errno.h inclusion.

* 9259826cc ("res_counter: remove include of cgroup.h from
  res_counter.h") removed cgroup.h inclusion.

And can be resolved like the following - errno.h added and cgroup.h
removed.  Just in case, test merge is available in the
test-merge-v3.10 branch.

  #include <linux/spinlock.h>
  #include <linux/errno.h>

Also, ff794dea52ea ("cpuset: remove include of cgroup.h from
cpuset.h") caused build failure on ppc64 because
arch/powerpc/mm/numa.c was getting slab.h through cpuset.h.  Stephen
noticed this in -next and provided the following patch.  I think
Benjamin is gonna pick this up before pushing the ppc tree but in case
it breaks for you the patch is at

  http://marc.info/?l=linux-next&m=136720831327947&w=2

Thanks.
