What does this?  Or are you saying that this is a bad thing?

(And *please* don't write software that *depends* on different
processes having different read()/write() permissions on the *same*
struct file.  I've already found multiple privilege escalations based
on that, and I'm pretty sure I can find some more.)

I think everyone agrees that this is broken.  We don't agree on the
fix check.  (Also, as described in my other email, your approach may
be really hard to get right.)
