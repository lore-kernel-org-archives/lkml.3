Andy you seem to be arguing here for two system calls.
get_urandom() and get_random().

Where get_urandom only blocks if there is not enough starting entropy,
and get_random(GRND_RANDOM) blocks if there is currently not enough
entropy.

That would allow -ENOSYS to be the right return value and it would
simply things for everyone.
