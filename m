But that's not relevant to us.  This is the problem of practical vs
standards approaches.  We have to support older and buggy devices.  Most
small USB storage sticks die if they see 16 byte CDB commands because
their interpreters.  The more "legacy baggage" the standards committee
dumps, the greater the number of heuristics OSs have to have to cope
with the plethora of odd devices.

OK, but look at it from our point of view:  The reply above justifies
why we prefer 10 byte CDBs over 16.  If the standards body ever did
remove SC(10) completely, then we'd have to have yet another heuristic
to recognise devices that don't support SC(10), but until that day,
using SC(10) alone works in all cases, so is the better path for the OS.

If you could, please get the standards body to recognise that the more
command churn they introduce (in the name of rationalisation or
whatever), the more problems they introduce for Operating Systems and
the more likelihood (because of different people reading different
revisions of standards) that we end up with compliance bugs in devices.
