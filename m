We have, it's jiffies ... that's why I'm slightly non-plussed that this
driver is using gettimeofday for something like this ... it was clearly
a review failure when we put it in.

or are you thinking we need a time_t_time_before doing for time_t what
we do for jiffies?

Right, and it's a 32 bit read instead of a system call every time the
thing dispatches a command ... to be honest the overhead of 64 bit
arithmetic is peanuts to making a syscall in the fast path.
