I don't know of anyone currently working on it. There are a couple of
possible approaches to fixing it, I think:

1) if the dentries to get down to the root of the mount don't already
exist, then attach some sort of "placeholder" inode that can be fleshed
out later if and when the dentry is accessed via other means.

2) do something like what NFS does (see commit 54ceac45). This becomes
a bit more complicated due to the fact that the server may not hand out
real inode numbers and we sometimes have to fake them up.

#1 is probably simpler to implement, but I'll confess that I haven't
thought through all of the potential problems with it.
