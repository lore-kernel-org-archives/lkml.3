Yeh tiresome, especially for fixing some leaks that affect the kernel
and ASLR for a long time now...

Ok response below:

You mean /proc/<b's pid>/syscall, ok let see

Please see with me:

I've made it clear that proc_allow_access() should be used after
ptrace_may_access() and documented it!

The reader process a  will have a ptrace_may_access() check against the
target process b (the setcap'd binary) during that ->read()

->read()
  -> syscall_read()
    -> lock_trace()
      -> ptrace_may_access()
        -> security_ptrace_access_check()

So the scenario you describe here is perfectly handled.


But your point on the *capabilities superset* is correct, YES.

What if a, the reader who execve a setcap'd binary. I admit there is a
window here :-)


Please see:

I did the check in the proc_same_open_cred() function:
 return (uid_eq(fcred->uid, cred->uid) &&
	 gid_eq(fcred->gid, cred->gid) &&
	 cap_issubset(cred->cap_permitted, fcred->cap_permitted));

Check if this is the same uid/gid and the capabilities superset!

But in the proc_allow_access() the capabilities superset is missing.


So to fix it:
1) if proc_same_open_cred() detects that cred have changed between
->open() and ->read() then abort, return zero, the ->read(),write()...


2) Improve the proc_allow_access() check by:
   if this is the same user namespace then check uid/gid of f_cred on
   target cred task, and the capabilities superset:
   cap_issubset(tcred->cap_permitted, fcred->cap_permitted));
   
   If it fails let security_capable() or file_ns_capable() do its magic.



The capabilities superset check are available, they are not LSM
specific.

IIUC, then SELinux is already broken!

You do you realize that these patches are adding a bench of
ptrace_may_access() during ->open() to give LSM a chance to inspect
f_cred and other things.

As I've said I'm not against revoke. If it was there I would use it!

Not implemented! and perhaps it will be complex...


Please respond, and perhaps you should reconsider your NAK! since you
were involved in the patches that were committed, and used the
file->f_cred approach
