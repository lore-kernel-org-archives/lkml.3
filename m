OK, I changed that. BTW. what happens if that code path is executed as a 
result of a command submitted via SG_IO? Is it correct to call sd_config_* 
or modify req->__data_len in that case? The WRITE_SAME path modifies 
req->__data_len too.

Is there some software iSCSI implementation that supports these commands? 
Target core doesn't seem to support them. If it doesn't support them, I 
can't test it.

SPC-4 lists the command as RECEIVE_COPY_RESULTS and Linux already uses 
that name in the target-core driver.
