I confirmed that this problem goes away if systemd-udevd supports longer
timeout.

Right. But mptsas_probe() triggering an OOPS is irrelevant to kthread_run()
( comment #27 ).

I confirmed that device initialization really took more than 30 seconds
( comments #51 and #52 ).

The probe did not hang. SIGKILL affected only wait_for_completion_killable()
in kthread_create_on_node() called by mptsas_probe() via scsi_host_alloc().
Thus, the probe was interrupted because kthread_run() returned an error.

I do seriously care about TIF_MEMDIE/oom. Last week I respond to a trouble
which hit "kernel: request_module() OOM local DoS" (RHBZ #853474) without
any malice.

Then, what happens if somebody does

  while (1)
      kill(pid, SIGKILL);

where pid is the process calling kthread_run() from the "for (;;)" loop in
scsi_host_alloc()? Theoretically, it will form an infinite retry loop.
Clearing TIF_SIGPENDING does not guarantee that next
wait_for_completion_killable() does not return immediately.
Doing retry decision at scsi_host_alloc() will make things worse than
doing it at kthread_create_on_node().

Right. We found that we can fix this problem by updating systemd-udevd to
support longer timeout ( comment #53 ). Joseph, would you consult systemd
maintainers?
