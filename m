When I say "writes something" I mean literally performs a store to
memory.  That is:

ptr[offset] = value;

In my example, the client will *never* catch up.

And this is why I'm unconvinced that your requirement is sensible.
It's attempting to make sure that every mmaped write results in a some
kind of FS update, but it actually only results in an FS update
*before* the *first* mmapped write after writeback.  It's racy as
hell.

My approach is slow but not racy.
