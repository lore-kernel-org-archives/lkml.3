Yeah, it's not clear how this is going to work yet, but I'd expect a new
backend driver will be required for exposing NVMe hardware queues into
target -> fabric driver code.

I don't believe any public code is available yet, and considering the
draft spec is only available to members of the NVMe consortium, it's
likely going to be a while before that happens.

However, Dave mentioned off-list that sharing early code amongst NVMe
consortium members should not be an issue.
