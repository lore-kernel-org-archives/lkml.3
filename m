Take two threads, one doing a list_for_each_entry_safe loop and
dropping the lock after list_del, the other doing list_add.  Result is
that you finish the list_for_each_entry_safe loop with something
remaining on the list.

spin_lock
list_for_each_entry_safe
	list_del
	spin_unlock
			spin_lock
			list_add
			spin_unlock

If you search for this pattern in the kernel, you won't find too many
examples.  Quite likely that is because a) people realized this and
used a while (!list_empty()) loop to begin with or b) they started out
wrong and fixed the bug later.  Not sure how many examples of b) there
are.

At any rate, this is a purely janitorial patch.  It is almost by
definition of moderate utility and if there is significant opposition
or the patch actually causes harm in some way, we should drop it.
