This would be more than surprising because tasks blocked at memcg OOM
don't hold any locks anymore. Maybe I have messed something up during
backport but I cannot spot anything.

So you are not testing with the same kernel with just the old patch
replaced by the new one?

I would be really interesting to see what those tasks are blocked on.

sysrq+t will give you the list of all tasks and their traces.

None yet. But I hope it will be merged to 3.11 and backported to the
stable trees.
