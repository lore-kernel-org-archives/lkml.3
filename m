If you tie your userland to the most recent kernel and then want to
bisect an old bug, you will have a problem. You could try to find
another userland that supports the older kernels, but it would be *much*
easier if you could just use your current userland with it because then
the bare minimum must change. Writing portable software is the way to do
that.

Why burn the bridges that allow us to look backward when we have such a
need?

If a bug in kdbusfs that allows arbitrary code execution is exploited in
the wild, would kdbus be more secure than a userland version?

What are some examples of these programs? Are any of them examples of
good software design?

What keeps userspace from passing around memfds?

How much metadata can be attached in either case? is there some inherit
aspect of the existing syscall API that prevents userspace from
attaching more? Why do we want to attach more?

Is the current dbus daemon not supporting this this only thing
preventing us from doing it in userspace?

Does being in the kernel solve this in a way that using memfds in
userspace does not?

Why do we want to start D-Bus inside the initramfs?
