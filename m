Some of the latter paragraphs seem ambiguous and just plain wrong.
In particular the break_lease comment makes no sense. We call
break_lease (and break_deleg) from all sorts of vfs-layer functions,
so there is clearly such a method.

Also get rid of some of the other comments about what's needed for
a full implementation.
