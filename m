Right -- that's the part where we have to take great care to save the
state of the syscall at the time we returned back up toward userland on
a freeze event. I suppose we'd need to hang something off the
task_struct to keep track of that.

In most cases, it would be sufficient to keep track of whether an RPC
had been sent during the call for non-idempotent operations. If it was
sent, then we'd just re-enter the wait for the reply. If it wasn't then
we'd go ahead and send the call.

Still, I'm sure there are details I'm overlooking here. The whole point
of holding these mutexes is to ensure that operations that the
directories don't change while we're doing these operations. If we
release the locks in order to go to sleep, then there's no guarantee
that things haven't changed when we reacquire them.

Maybe it's best to give up and just tell people that suspending your
laptop with a NFS mount is not allowed :P
