   You've said this before, having made exactly the same error (not
testing a patch). Yet you do it again. You seem to be ignoring all the
advice you've been given -- or at least not learning from it, and not
learning from your experiences. Could you please, for half an hour or
so, stop thinking about the immediate goal of getting a patch into the
kernel, and take a short while to think about your process of
learning. Look at all the advice you've had (from me, from Ted, from
others), actually understand it, and consider all the things you need
to do which *aren't* hacking up a lump of C. Actually learn these
things -- have them in your mind all the time.

   I would appreciate it if you could actually engage with someone
(doesn't have to be me) about this -- why are you ignoring the advice?
Is it because you don't understand it? Is it because you think you can
cut corners? Is it because you're concetrating on the code so much that
you're forgetting it?

   The main thing you're doing which is making people angry is not
because you're submitting bad patches (although you are). It's because
you're not listening to advice, and you're not apparently learning
anything from the feedback you're given. Your behaviour is not
changing over time, which makes you look like a waste of time to all
those people trying to help you.

   Hugo.
