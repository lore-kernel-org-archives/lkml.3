I don't see that spelled out in the -2 family of standards (SAM-2 /
SPC-2 / SBC-2). We're only claiming SPC-2 compliance; perhaps that's
something that got clarified in a later version?

One precondition for the infinite loop that got lost between
investigation of the problem and submission of the patch is that the
device has to identify itself BOTH as  "non-removable" and "write
protected". The reason is this clause in sd_open():

    if (sdev->removable || sdkp->write_prot)
        check_disk_change(bdev);

...which causes READ CAPACITY to be issued, to which the device responds
MEDIUM NOT PRESENT, which causes set_media_not_present() to be invoked
and to signal another "changed" event for userland.

Apologies for the oversight.

I think that concern is easily addressed by tweaking the patch to keep
the "sdkp->capacity = 0" statement conditional on
sdkp->device->removable.

Being a USB Mass Storage device, it is removable from a USB sense, but
not I think in a SCSI sense - there is no ejectable cartridge or
anything. Commands like PREVENT ALLOW MEDIUM REMOVAL, which
identification as removable usually triggers, are nonsensical.

The scenario is generally one of these two uncommon use cases:

1. The device has come up in "failsafe mode" because the user damaged
the normal "operational" microcode by yanking power during an
operational microcode update. Failsafe mode allows for microcode update,
and not much else.

B. The internal controller has experienced an unrecoverable error
(reported with appropriate sense codes) during normal operation and the
USB connection has since been cycled (disconnected and reconnected; the
device is wall-powered, not bus-powered). 

I don't think either is invalid. 

I will stipulate that declaring a block device write-protected when no
medium is present does not make a whole lot of sense, and that's
something we will address going forward. However, I do think it's a Bad
Thing (from a security perspective, at minimum) if simply connecting a
device to a machine can bring down the system. The Windows FAT driver
has such issues. Surely Linux can do better, at least in this particular
case where only a minor tweak is needed, not even the addition of
defensive code.
