Except when we would handle the first level under root differently,
which is ugly.

I had a patch for this somewhere on the think_more pile. I wasn't
particularly happy about the semantic so I haven't posted it.

This is OK for the OOM knob because the memory pressure cannot be
handled at that level in hierarchy and that is where the OOM happens.

I am not so sure about the swappiness though. The swappiness tells us
how to proportionally scan anon vs. file LRUs and those are per-memcg,
not per-hierarchy (unlike the charge) so it makes sense to use it
per-memcg IMO.

Besides that using the reclaim target value might be quite confusing.
Say, somebody wants to prevent from swapping in a certain group and
yet the pages find their way to swap depending on where the reclaim is
triggered from.
Another thing would be that setting swappiness on an unlimited group has
no effect although I would argue it makes some sense in configuration
when parent is controlled by somebody else. I would like to tell how
to reclaim me when I cannot say how much memory I can have. 

It is true that we have a different behavior for the global reclaim
already but I am not entirely happy about that. Having a different
behavior for the global vs. limit reclaims just calls for troubles and
should be avoided as much as possible.

So let's think what is the best semantic before we merge this. I would
be more inclined for using per-memcg swappiness all the time (root using
the global knob) for all reclaims.

I am OK with the change but I think we should discuss the semantic
first.
