XFS doesn't use range locks (yet).

Wouldn't the easiest "support all filesystems" hack just be to add
a destination offset parameter to do_splice_direct() and call that
when the filesystem doesn't supply a ->copy_range method? i.e. use
the mechanisms we already have for copying from one file to another
via the page cache as efficiently as possible?

Cheers,

Dave.
