If fatal error handling is the only concern then the only required
query/DM commands, I guess you are talking about fDeviceInit and NOP,
for the recovery can be sent internally. Moreover, it doesn't matter
on which available slot the query/DM commands are sent during the
fatal error handling since the SCSI layer is blocked. Once the
recovery completes,  query commands can go on without reserving an
exclusive slot.

Always nutrs=32 is the assumption you are making. Spec mentions that
(1 <= nutrs <=32) and (1 <= nutmrs <= 8), and unfortunately I did come
across a host controller with nutrs=4, nutmrs=2 sometime back.
Reserving an exclusive slot for query in such cases would make a
difference. Hope this helps.
