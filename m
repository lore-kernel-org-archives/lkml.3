Sure. Didn't write it in the first instance because I though to squash it
in 2/3. But it is actually fixing a different issue, so please find it
below.

Right. I think that is a separate (PI related) issue. But we could also
wait for that to be nailed down and then apply all the fixes at once.
As you think is better.

Thanks,

Subject: [PATCH] sched/deadline: ensure that updates to exclusive cpusets
 don't break AC

How we deal with updates to exclusive cpusets is currently broken.
As an example, suppose we have an exclusive cpuset composed of
two cpus: A[cpu0,cpu1]. We can assign SCHED_DEADLINE task to it
up to the allowed bandwidth. If we want now to modify cpusetA's
cpumask, we have to check that removing a cpu's amount of
bandwidth doesn't break AC guarantees. This thing isn't checked
in the current code.

This patch fixes the problem above, denying an update if the
new cpumask won't have enough bandwidth for SCHED_DEADLINE tasks
that are currently active.
