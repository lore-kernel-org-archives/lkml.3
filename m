As we are all in a way sons of Linus the Great, the fact that you have
this usecase should be by itself a reason for us not to deprecate it.

I still view this, however, as a not common use case. And from the
scheduler PoV, we still have all the duplicate hierarchy walks. So
assuming we would carry on all the changes in this patchset, except the
deprecation, would it be okay for you?

This way we could take steps to make sure the scheduler codepaths for
cpuacct are not taking during normal comounted operation, and you could
still have your setup unchanged.

Tejun, any words here?
