Hi Tomas,

Although in http://www.makelinux.net/ldd3/chp-7-sect-6, there said to flush the shared workqueue requires calling function
flush_scheduled_work.

But in kernel workqueue.c, there are comment of flush_scheduled_work said that 
"In most situations flushing the entire workqueue is overkill; you merely need to know that a particular work item isn't
queued and isn't running."

In such cases use flush_work is OK.
This can be proved in so many kernel device driver calling flush_work instead of flush_scheduled_work.
