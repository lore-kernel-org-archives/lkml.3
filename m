You can enter DEF_PRIORITY reclaim 16 times and reclaim your target but
you need at least 512<<DEF_PRIORITY pages on your LRUs to do it in a
single run on that priority. So especially small groups will pay more
and would be subject to mentioned problems (e.g. over-reclaim).

Now I am confused. shrink_zone will bail out but shrink_lruvec will loop
over nr[...] until they are empty and only updates the numbers to be
roughly proportional once:

                if (nr_reclaimed < nr_to_reclaim || scan_adjusted)
                        continue;

                /*
                 * For kswapd and memcg, reclaim at least the number of pages
                 * requested. Ensure that the anon and file LRUs are scanned
                 * proportionally what was requested by get_scan_count(). We
                 * stop reclaiming one LRU and reduce the amount scanning
                 * proportional to the original scan target.
                 */
		[...]
		scan_adjusted = true;

Or do you rely on
                /*
                 * It's just vindictive to attack the larger once the smaller
                 * has gone to zero.  And given the way we stop scanning the
                 * smaller below, this makes sure that we only make one nudge
                 * towards proportionality once we've got nr_to_reclaim.
                 */
                if (!nr_file || !nr_anon)
                        break;

and SCAN_FILE because !inactive_file_is_low?
