While I seem to understand the motivation, I don't really like moving code
around, especially in the ia64 area where we have limited means to test the
changes.  And I hate code duplication pretty much in any form.

Also I don't see anything wrong with sharing code between x86 and ia64 like
we do today.

So, why don't you move the _OSI handling out of osl.c into a separate file
that will only build if something like CONFIG_ARCH_SPECIFIC_ACPI_OSI is not
set (and same for blacklist.c).  Then, you'll only need to make ARM64
set CONFIG_ARCH_SPECIFIC_ACPI_OSI and provide the necessary functions
and you can leave the other architectures alone.

Does that make sense to you?
