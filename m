Thanks. However I still think this needs more investigation. May be I'll
write another email, but given that maintainers do not care...

It doesn't hang forever. Otherwise see above.

This wad already clear,

No, #51 / #52 can't prove this. I think that kthread_run() or even
scsi_host_alloc() was called with fatal_signal_pending(). What did the probe
task do before? This is not clear. But again, see above.

Nothing good. So what?

Tetsuo, how many time I should repeat that I only tried to suggest the
temporary dirty hack to close the regression ? ;)

And once again, I agree with any change in scsi_host_alloc/etc, I suggested
this (pseudo) code for example.

OK, good, thanks.

But please do not forget that the kernel crashes. Whatever else we do, this
should be fixed anyway. And this should be fixed in driver.

Oleg.
