Since this change would immediately break files encoded with pre-1970 =
dates
on ext4 filesystems, should there be a transition period where both =
pre-1970
dates (with extra epoch bits =3D=3D 0x3 in the current encoding) and =
post-2378
(with extra epoch bits =3D=3D 0x3 in the new encoding) are decoded as =
being
pre-1970?  That could be conditional until some release in the future =
(e.g.
>=3D Linux 4.20, at least 5 years away) to give folks a chance to run =
the new
e2fsck to fix up those files.

Are there really any ext4 filesystems that have files with valid dates =
so old?
I don=92t want to break anyone=92s data, but if this extra complexity is =
completely
pointless then I=92m also fine with this minor risk of breakage.

Cheers, Andreas
