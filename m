I agree that a server should normally be doing the wait on its own if
the wait would be on the order of an rpc round trip.

So I'd be inclined to start with a delay that was an order of magnitude
or two more than a round trip.

And I'd expect NFS isn't common on networks with 1-second latencies.

So the 1/10 second we're using in the synchronous case sounds closer to
the right ballpark to me.
