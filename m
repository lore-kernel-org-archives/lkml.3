I think the right answer for 3.2 is to drop commit 584ec1226519 "isci:
fix reset timeout handling".

libsas and its libata interaction went through significant overhaul
after 3.2 so it's not surprising that a change to reset handling
regresses like this.

Ideally there would be a backport of latest libsas available for 3.2,
but no one to my knowledge is working on that.
