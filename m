It's good to have this kind of introduction but it really belongs ot the
cover letter not the individual patches.

Now that I see that, I'm not sure that my previous comment about 'one
patch per function' is the right way to go. This patch looks good as it
stands. The change is simple enough that I won't be opposed to grouping
even more functions together as long as it stays revieweable.

The patches are likely to clash with a lot of pending patches, so you
may want to base it on the integration branch next time. This would make
maintainers' life easier and also raises chances to merge the patches.
