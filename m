I use this test program that faults in anon pages, reports average and
max for every 512-page chunk (THP size), then reports the aggregate at
the end:

memory.max:

avg=18729us max=450625us

real    0m14.335s
user    0m0.157s
sys     0m6.307s

memory.high:

avg=18676us max=457499us

real    0m14.375s
user    0m0.046s
sys     0m4.294s

This is about defining the limit semantics in unified hierarchy, and
not really the time or place to optimize THP charge latency.

What are you trying to accomplish here?

You made unfounded claims about THP allocation latencies, and I showed
the numbers to refute it, but that doesn't make any of this relevant
for the changelogs of these patches.
