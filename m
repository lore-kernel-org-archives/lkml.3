Nothing prevents it. If somebody grabbed a share mode lock on a file
before we call deny_lock_file, we simply close this file and return
-ETXTBSY. We can't grab it before atomic_open because we don't have an
inode there. Anyway, we can't make it atomic for VFS without big code
changes, but for CIFS and NFS it is already atomic with the discussed
patch.
