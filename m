Well, ignoring the ABI break that landed in the last year. :)

So my main concerns/thoughts here are:

Who is going to maintain this? Has Arve agreed?  Are the Android guys
comfortable with the ABI stability rules they'll now face?  Currently
in the android space no one but libbinder should use the kernel
interface. Can we enforce that no one use this interface out-side of
android (To ensure its one of those "if the abi breaks and no one
notices..." edge cases)?

I'm still hopeful that a libbinder over kdbus will eventually pan out.
I still see having two core IPC mechanisms (even if the use cases are
different in style) as a negative, and I worry this might reduce
motivation to unify things at the lower level. Granted, such work can
still continue, but the incentives do change.

thanks
