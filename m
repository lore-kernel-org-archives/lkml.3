Actually libcg doesn't really try to play nice with anything - being
just a direct representation of the cgroups filesystem, it allows for
absolutely anything to be done with no regard for best practice or
co-operation.

The PaxControlGroups document is the key piece to making distributed
management work. This document does need updating, since some of what
it describes doesn't really work, but its goal is sound IMHO.

The Workman library is presuming that apps will follow the PaxControlGroups
guidelines for use of cgroups, and from there aims to provide system
administrators with a "single world view" and tools to then configure
this. It does not, however, attempt to force itself underneath the
apps like systemd / libvirt, since there is no need todo that. It
just aggregates information from system/libvirt/etc so that admin has
the complete picture of what the cgroups are being used for.

I agree that whatever is setting weight values needs to be aware of
what other weight values are set at the same point in the hiearchy.
This doesn't imply we have to have a single authority setting these
values though, just that anything that wants to set them, needs to
be aware of the bigger picture.

I don't see that creating a "single authority" magically solves any
of the problems you describe. For example, such an authority can't
know whether it should delete a cgroup just because an application
exits. It is quite possible an application would want the cgroup to
continue to exist, so that it is still there when it restarts.

Ultimately it is the end admin or top level management tool that has
the whole picture. The Workman library / cli is aiming to provide
admins / apps with the complete picture of everything that is using
resources on the system, so they can adjust policies dynamically.

You seem to be implying that 'distributed == anything goes', which is
certainly not what I consider to be the case. Indeed the main point
of having the PaxControlGroups guidelines is explicitly because we do
*not* want an "anything goes" approach.

We ultimately do need the ability to delegate hierarchy creation to
unprivileged users / programs, in order to allow containerized OS to
have the ability to use cgroups. Requiring any applications inside a
container to talk to a cgroups "authority" existing on the host OS is
not a satisfactory architecture. We need to allow for a container to
be self-contained in its usage of cgroups.

At the same time, we don't need/want to give them unrestricted ability
to create arbitarily complex hiearchies - we need some limits on it
to avoid them exposing pathelogically bad kernel behaviour.

This could be as simple as saying that each cgroup controller directory
has a tunable "cgroups.max_children" and/or "cgroups.max_depth" which
allow limits to be placed when delegating administration of part of a
cgroups tree to an unprivileged user.

I don't think that requiring a single userspace authority is
satisfactory. We need to be able to delegate this to containers,
without them needing to talk to some authority back in the
host OS, so that they remain 100% isolated from processes in
the host OS.

I've no disagreement that we need a unified hiearchy. The workman
app explicitly does /not/ expose the concept of differing hiearchies
per controller. Likewise libvirt will not allow the user to configure
non-unified hiearchies.

We need to make the distribute approach work in order to support
containers, which requiring them to have a back-channel open to
the host userspace. If we can do that, then we've solved the problem
of delegated to unprivileged users in non-container environments too.
IMHO with a sufficiently specified PaxControlGroups the distributed
approach is just fine. If applications are badly behaved and don't
follow the rules, then so be it, file bugs against those apps. Both
libvirt & systemd are committed to following rules for co-operating
in usage of cgroups & Workman can provide a "single unified view"
for the administrator without requiring a single authority too.
