Agreed. If you can think of a better spot to put this, I'd be happy to
move it in the next iteration of this series.

Good point -- I'll fix that up. That one was mostly for my own benefit
while trying to figure out how this code works. It's still probably worth
some more verbose comments here since this certainly wasn't 100%
obvious to me when I first dove into this code.

Yeah. I think that latter point accounts for a lot of the difficulty for
the uninitiated to understand this code.

I considered creating a "struct lock_request" too. If I were designing
this code from scratch I certainly would do so, but it's harder to
justify such a change to the existing code.

It would mean a lot of churn in fs-specific lock routines, and we'd
have to completely revamp things like locks_copy_lock. I just don't see
that giving us a lot of benefit in the near term and I really want this
set to focus on concrete benefits.

We might consider it in the future though. I'll add a FIXME comment
here so we can record the idea for posterity.

Thanks for the comments!
