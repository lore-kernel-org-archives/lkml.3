This sounds rather nasty and hacky.  Rather then working around a
locking shortcoming in a caller it would be better to fix/enhance the
core locking code.  What would such a change need to do?

Presently rwsem waiters are fifo-queued, are they not?  So the commit
thread will eventually get that lock.  Apparently that's not working
adequately for you but I don't fully understand what it is about these
dynamics which is causing observable problems.

This will break CONFIG_RWSEM_GENERIC_SPINLOCK=n?
