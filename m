Actually, replacing the inline function with a bit of macro hell seems
to yield identical object size again.  And in the case of
compression.o, it even removes 528 bytes or so of object code.

New 1/2 below.

[PATCH 1/2] list: add list_for_each_entry_del

I have seen a lot of boilerplate code that either follows the pattern of
	while (!list_empty(head)) {
		pos = list_entry(head->next, struct foo, list);
		list_del(pos->list);
		...
	}
or some variant thereof.

With this patch in, people can use
	list_for_each_entry_del(pos, head, list) {
		...
	}

The patch also adds a list_for_each_del variant, even though I have
only found a single user for that one so far.
