Reply inline, with a good bit of snipping done (posting via gmane, so

Another use case is in supporting various image formats, like (say) qcow2, 
and then handing those off to vhost_scsi.

As long as people don't start calling it L[UNs in ]USER[space] :P

Between that and ABUSE (A Block device in USErspace), this domain has some 
real naming potential...

It might be good to change this somewhat; in the vast majority of cases it'd 
be saner for userspace programs to figure this information out via udev etc. 
rather than parsing sysfs themselves. This information is still worth 
documenting, but saying things like "must find their devices by scanning 
sysfs" is likely to lead to users of this interface making suboptimal 
choices.

Is there a cleaner way to do this? In particular, re-scanning sysfs may 
cause race conditions (device removed, one of the same name re-added but a 
different UIO device node; probably more to be found). Perhaps recommend 
netlink uevents, so that remove+add is noticeable? Also, is the SIGHUP 
itself the best option? Could we simply require the user process to listen 
for add/remove uevents to get such change notifications, and thus enforce 
good behavior?

One use case I'm actually interested in is having userspace provide 
something other than just SPC - for instance, tgt can provide a virtual tape 
library or an OSD, and CDemu can provide emulated optical discs from various 
image formats.

Currently, CDemu uses its own out-of-tree driver called VHBA (Virtual Host 
Bus Adapter) to do pretty much exactly what TCMU+Loopback would 
accomplish... and in the process misses out on all of the other fabrics, 
unless you're willing to _re-import_ those devices using PSCSI, which has 
its own quirks.

Perhaps there could be a level 0 (or 4, or whatever) which means "explicitly 
enabled list of commands" - maybe as a bitmap that could be passed to the 
kernel somehow? Hopefully, that could also avoid some of the quirks of PSCSI 
regarding ALUA and such - if it's not implemented, leave the relevant bits 
at zero, and LIO handles it.

This does look really nice, thanks for writing it!
