Andrew, I've now given my Ack to all of these, and think they are
ready for inclusion in mmotm, if you agree with the addition of
this sealing feature and the memfd_create() syscall.

Andy Lutomirsky and I agree that it's somewhat unsatisfactory that a
sealed sparse file could be passed, and inflate to something OOMing
when read by the recipient; but I think we can live with that as a
limitation of the initial implementation (the suspicious recipient
can verify non-sparseness with lseek SEEK_HOLE), and it's my job
to work on fixing that aspect - though probably not for 3.17.

Thanks,
Hugh
