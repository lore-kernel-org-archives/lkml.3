  So I personally like EROFS more as well. However blkdev_get_by_path()
(which is what mount(2) uses) returns EACCES if the device is read-only and
FMODE_WRITE was requested. Also the manpage for mount(2) talks about
EACCES when RW mount of read-only device was requested and doesn't mention
EROFS at all.

Now mount(8) handles both EROFS and EACCES the same way but I wanted to
stay on the safer side in case someone uses mount(2) directly so I used
more common EACCES.

I can create a separate patch changing all EACCES return values in this
area to EROFS but I'm not sure it is worth the possible hassle with
userspace...
