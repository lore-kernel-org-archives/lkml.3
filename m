Sorry I missed the scsi lists on the summary patch.

While browsing the code I found another spot in mmc layer which
needs fixing. The patch is at the end of the email with Chris
and linux-mmc cc'ed here.

Subject: [PATCH] mmc: Use dma_max_pfn(dev) helper for bounce_limit
 calculations

DMA bounce limit is the maximum direct DMA'able memory beyond which
bounce buffers has to be used to perform dma operations. MMC queue layer
relies on dma_mask but its calculation is based on max_*pfn which
don't have uniform meaning across architectures. So make use of
dma_max_pfn() which is expected to return the DMAable maximum pfn
value across architectures.
