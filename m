That's unexpected.  It's not much, but how could the object size grow
at all when that much code is removed and we replace the lookups with
simple struct member accesses?  Are you positive these are the right
object files, in the right order?

On 32 bit, the overhead is 0.098% of memory, so 4MB on a 4G machine.
This should be acceptable, even for the three people that run on the
cutting edge of 3.18-based PAE distribution kernels. :-)

Which part?
