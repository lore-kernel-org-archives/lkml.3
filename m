See my question about the non-memcg page allocator behavior below.

That's precisely the point, the successful charges can allow additional 
page allocations to occur and cause system oom conditions if you don't 
have memcg isolation.  Some customers, including us, use memcg to ensure 
that a set of processes cannot use more resources than allowed.  Any 
bypass opens up the possibility of additional memory allocations that 
cause the system to be oom and then we end up requiring a userspace oom 
handler because our policy is complex enough that it cannot be effected 
simply by /proc/pid/oom_score_adj.

I'm not quite sure how significant of a point this is, though, because it 
depends on the caller doing the __GFP_NOFAIL allocations that allow the 
bypass.  If you're doing

	for (i = 0; i < 1 << 20; i++)
		page[i] = alloc_page(GFP_NOFS | __GFP_NOFAIL);

it can become significant, but I'm unsure of how much memory all callers 
end up allocating in this context.

I'm referring to the generic non-memcg page allocator behavior.  Forget 
memcg for a moment.  What is the behavior in the _page_allocator_ for 
GFP_NOFS | __GFP_NOFAIL?  Do we spin forever if reclaim fails or do we 
bypas the per-zone min watermarks to allow it to allocate because "it 
needs to succeed, it may be holding filesystem locks"?

It's already been acknowledged in this thread that no bypassing is done 
in the page allocator and it just spins.  There's some handwaving saying 
that since the entire system is oom that there is a greater chance that 
memory will be freed by something else, but that's just handwaving and is 
certainly no guaranteed.

So, my question again: why not bypass the per-zone min watermarks in the 
page allocator?
