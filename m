How does that support your assertion that setting a SHARE_BOTH mode
turns off the exception? There is no mention of share modes there. All
it says is that you should grant read permissions when the execute bit
is set in the ACL.

That's example code from one server implementation. It's not from
authoritative source.


Frank, the bottom line is that I'm not going to accept that patch as
it stands, because it is wrong.
The right fix here seems rather to be to put in an exception if the
data->file_created flag is set. I'll write a patch.
