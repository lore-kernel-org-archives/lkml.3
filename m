Subject: [PATCH v4] vsprintf: Check real user/group id for %pK
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Some setuid binaries will allow reading of files which have read
permission by the real user id. This is problematic with files which
use %pK because the file access permission is checked at open() time,
but the kptr_restrict setting is checked at read() time. If a setuid
binary opens a %pK file as an unprivileged user, and then elevates
permissions before reading the file, then kernel pointer values may be
leaked.

This happens for example with the setuid pppd application on Ubuntu 12.04:

  $ head -1 /proc/kallsyms
  00000000 T startup_32

  $ pppd file /proc/kallsyms
  pppd: In file /proc/kallsyms: unrecognized option 'c1000000'

This will only leak the pointer value from the first line, but other
setuid binaries may leak more information.

Fix this by adding a check that in addition to the current process
having CAP_SYSLOG, that effective user and group ids are equal to the
real ids. If a setuid binary reads the contents of a file which uses
%pK then the pointer values will be printed as NULL if the real user
is unprivileged.

Update the sysctl documentation to reflect the changes, and also
correct the documentation to state the kptr_restrict=0 is the default.

This is a only temporary solution to the issue. The correct solution
is to do the permission check at open() time on files, and to replace
%pK with a function which checks the open() time permission. %pK uses
in printk should be removed since no sane permission check can be
done, and instead protected by using dmesg_restrict.

This is a temporary solution only, but fixes a minor security hole when
kptr_restrict=1. I am working to fix this properly, but there is still
some discussion around how to achieve this, see here:

  https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/10/10/805

This solution at least resolves the problem, and can easily be cherry
picked into stable/distro kernels as needed.

Changes since v3:
  * Update the sysctl documentation to detail the reasons for the check
    and also explain the temporary nature of the solution.
  * Added Cc stable, since this patch should probably be applied to
    stable kernels, and possibly distro kernels.
  * Cc'ed people for Documentation changes

Changes since v2:
  * Fixed typo in comment: 'proccess' -> 'process'
  * Use a switch statement for the kptr_restrict values
  * Updated the sysctl documentation

Changes since v1:
  * Fix the description to say 'vsprintf' instead of 'printk'.
  * Clarify the open() vs read() time checks in the patch description
and code comment.
  * Remove comment about 'badly written' setuid binaries. This occurs
with setuids binaries which correctly handle opening files.
  * Added extra people to the Cc list.
