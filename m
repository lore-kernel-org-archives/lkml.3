Yes, the discussion is beginning to make it's way to the list.  I've
mostly been waiting for blk-mq to get a wider review before taking the
early scsi-mq prototype driver to a larger public audience.

Primarily, I'm now reaching out to the people most effected by existing
scsi_request_fn() based performance limitations.  Most of them have
abandoned existing scsi_request_fn() based logic in favor of raw block
make_request() based drivers, and are now estimating the amount of
effort to move to an scsi-mq based approach.

Regardless, as the prototype progresses over the next months, having a
face-to-face discussion with the key parties in the room would be very
helpful given the large amount of effort involved to actually make this
type of generational shift in SCSI actually happen.
