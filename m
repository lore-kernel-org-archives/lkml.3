Oh, sorry, I had misunderstood your question.

- Number of IOs serviced will be different at throttling layer and
  CFQ layer as throttling accounts IO in terms of bios and CFQ
  accounts in terms of number of requests.

- CFQ might not be operational on a device while throttling might be
  on and one needs bytes stats.

- In a custom kernel throttling might not be on and CFQ is on and
  one needs the stats.

So I think we do require duplication of some stats across throttling
and CFQ, isn't it?

Thanks
Vivek
