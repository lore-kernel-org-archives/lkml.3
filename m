That doesn't happen.  There's plenty of vendor-specific opcodes and mode
pages, not to mention out-of-band channels, e.g. work directly at the
USB level like the mode select stuff.

IIRC IOMEGA ZIP drives had some egregious abuse in READ and WRITE of the
boot sector, presenting fake partition tables or something like that.
But it wasn't using strange commands for that.

No, that doesn't happen either.  There's plenty of reserved opcodes, and
this time you can count on the standards people which are more
reasonable than vendors.

If it is not used, nobody will use it and nothing will break.

If it is used in a case we don't know, you'll have to add it later.

If it is little used and broken somewhere, you'll have to add it later
to the whitelist and implement the quirk.  Both of them.  Adding it now
saves a step.

The only case in which you save later work, is if someone bitches that X
doesn't work but nobody tells us.  Patch economy by obscurity. :)

I disagree.  It does not change anything.

If it is something really serious (i.e. it crashes the firmware), we'd
need a quirk anyway.  If it is something only slightly less stupid,
userspace can deal with broken hardware itself.  It is somewhat expected
with SG_IO anyway.  For virt, the guest would treat it the same as on
bare metal; for anything else, the program would already have to deal
with it if run as root.

Not if many of your uses are proprietary (Windows, AIX on PPC, z/OS on
s390, Oracle, SAP, you name it).

No problem.
