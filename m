I see. Users should decide whether or not to panic.
As Ric says, that should be done on file system or higher layer.

I'm now considering about handling SCSI error in user space with printk
error message as a fail over trigger. Currently, is there a nice
way to detect indefinite retry on SCSI layer?
/proc/sys/dev/scsi/logging_level can show detailed information about scsi
command but too much to detect indefinite retry.
How about adding printk error message when retry count exceed scmd->allowed
on each SCSI command?
