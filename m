Basically, I mean that rather than setting the fl_next pointer to NULL
while holding only the inode lock and then ignoring those locks in the
deadlock detection code, we should additionally take the global lock in
locks_wake_up_blocks too and take the blocked locks off the global list
and the i_flock list at the same time.

That actually might not be completely necessary, but it'll make the
logic clearer and easier to understand and probably won't hurt
performance too much. Again, I'll need to do some perf testing to be
sure.
