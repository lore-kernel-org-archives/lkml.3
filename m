Wow, this is adding expensive stuff in fast path, only for nfsd :(

BTW, why should the current->flags should be saved on a socket field,
and not a current->save_flags. This really looks a thread property, not
a socket one.

Why nfsd could not have PF_FSTRANS in its current->flags ?

For applications handling millions of sockets, this makes a difference.
