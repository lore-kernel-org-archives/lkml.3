Yeah, understood, thanks for the reminder.  I took another look and
found a simpler fix and wanted to reproduce.  Unfortunately the
reproducer depends on a lot of details (your git directory won't
necessarily work on somebody else's setup) so all I found was a brute
force attempt to create directories which lots of various-sized entries
(excuse the sloppy shell):

	j=74
	k=100
	while true; do 
		ssh root@f20-3 '
			cd /exports/xfs/DIR
			rm -f 00*
			for ((i=0; i<'$k'; i++)); do
				touch $(printf "%0'$j'.0f" $i); done
			for ((i='$k'; i<100; i++));
				do touch $(printf "%0'$((j+1))'.0f" $i); done
		'
		if ! diff <(ssh root@f20-3 ls /exports/xfs/DIR/) <(ls DIR); then
			echo "diff found at $j, $k"
			break
		fi
		echo $j, $((k--))
		if [ $k -eq 0 ]; then
			echo ---
			echo $((j+=4)), $((k=100))
		fi
	done

Now that I think of it there might be other operations (read, readlink)
that could trigger the same problem more easily.

But anyway that reproducer worked and confirmed the following which I'll
probably pass along upstream today or tomorrow....

commit 9f5b5c33b2ee
Author: J. Bruce Fields <bfields@redhat.com>

    rpc: fix xdr_truncate_encode to handle buffer ending on page boundary
    
    A struct xdr_stream at a page boundary might point to the end of one
    page or the beginning of the next, but xdr_truncate_encode isn't
    prepared to handle the former.
    
    This can cause corruption of NFSv4 READDIR replies in the case that a
    readdir entry that would have exceeded the client's dircount/maxcount
    limit would have ended exactly on a 4k page boundary.  You're more
    likely to hit this case on large directories.
    
    Other xdr_truncate_encode callers are probably also affected.
