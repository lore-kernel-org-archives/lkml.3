I think this would be amazingly expensive -- every constrained fd
would need to carry an entire mount namespace with it.  That namespace
might need to have shared recursive mounts under it.  And dfds created
for subdirectories would need yet another mount namespace.  And all
these mount namespaces would probably need user namespaces to go along
with them.

It would also have odd semantics.  If you have a dfd pointing to /foo,
and /foo/link is a symlink to "../bar", then looking up "link"
relative to /foo should fail; it should not try to resolve /foo/bar.

IOW I think this is impractical.
