You can't.  Unix domain sockets pass struct file references.
That is passing a file descriptor with a unix domain sockets is the
equivlanet of dup().

You absolutely must make your struct file read-only before passing it,
otherwise the the receiver will have a read-write instance.

This notion that a shared structure should have different semantics
depending on who is looking at it, sounds like a maintenance nightmare
to me.

Finer grained restrictions are perfectly sensible.

I don't see how it make sense to place those restrictions in
struct fdtable instead of in struct file.

I see two sensible implementations:
- Add a seccomp bpf filter to struct file.
- Add permission bits to struct file.

The bpf filter would allow for a simple code extension that would
allow any arbitrary policy to be applied.

Adding permisison bits to struct file for gating access to
file_operations and inode_operations would result in the fastest
possible implementation and something very easy to audit and
understand.  But there like ioctl or read/write on IB control files
where finer grained permissions might be desirable.

For a lot of operations we alread have bits like FMODE_READ and
FMODE_CAN_READ on struct file for reasons such as performance
so that only a single cache line needs to be touched.

It might be that it would be worth having both.  Something cheap and
genrally accessible and something fast.

I believe the capsicum approach is so far from allowing general proxy
objects that, that is not a compelling case.

Alright. About the same target as seccomp then.  Aiming at something
that is simple to adopt sounds like a reasonable goal.

They only need CAP_SYS_ADMIN in their local user namespace, which anyone
is allowed to create.

Nope.  What you can implement today if you want fine grained limitations
like this is to create a mount namespace with exactly the subdirectory
tree you want to allow access to and to return a file descriptor that
points into that mount namespace.  (When complete the only user of that
mount namespace would be your file descriptor).

In fact that solution is sufficiently performant and simple that even
if you came up with a better user space interface for it that is how we
would want to implement it.

And frankly that already exists today so I think a fairly large burden
of proof needs to be met to suggest that we need to add additional
functionality to the kernel.

Furthermore I think it makes sense for application authors to use
as otherwise they will have to wait a year or so for the debates to be
finished and your new functionality to be merged.

Additionally unless there is a process wide restriction to relative
paths I can trivially escape your relative path implementation by simply
doing open(.) and getting a struct file without any of those
restrictions.
