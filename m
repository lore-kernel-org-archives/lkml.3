OK. I’m guessing that you’re hitting the auto-probing code further down in nfs3_get_acl(), which also returns EOPNOTSUPP in those cases. Those probably need to return NULL too, then…

However, there seems to be an inconsistency in the whole API here: posix_acl_create() and posix_acl_chmod() seem to want to return ‘0’ both when acls are not supported and when they are not set, however posix_acl_xattr_get() wants to return EOPNOTSUPP in the first case, and ENODATA in the second. How is the filesystem supposed to know what to return?
