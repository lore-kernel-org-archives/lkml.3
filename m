The code for immediate arbitration was removed from (what looks like a
predecessor of) the ncr53c8xx code in v2.6.0. Remove its remnants now.

-10.7 IMMEDIATE ARBITRATION boot option
-
-This option is only supported by the SYM53C8XX driver (not by the NCR53C8XX).
-
-SYMBIOS 53C8XX chips are able to arbitrate for the SCSI BUS as soon as they 
-have detected an expected disconnection (BUS FREE PHASE). For this process 
-to be started, bit 1 of SCNTL1 IO register must be set when the chip is 
-connected to the SCSI BUS.
-
-When this feature has been enabled for the current connection, the chip has 
-every chance to win arbitration if only devices with lower priority are 
-competing for the SCSI BUS. By the way, when the chip is using SCSI id 7, 
-then it will for sure win the next SCSI BUS arbitration.
-
-Since, there is no way to know what devices are trying to arbitrate for the 
-BUS, using this feature can be extremely unfair. So, you are not advised
-to enable it, or at most enable this feature for the case the chip lost 
-the previous arbitration (boot option 'iarb:1').
-
-This feature has the following advantages:
-
-a) Allow the initiator with ID 7 to win arbitration when it wants so.
-b) Overlap at least 4 micro-seconds of arbitration time with the execution 
-   of SCRIPTS that deal with the end of the current connection and that 
-   starts the next job.
-
-Hmmm... But (a) may just prevent other devices from reselecting the initiator, 
-and delay data transfers or status/completions, and (b) may just waste 
-SCSI BUS bandwidth if the SCRIPTS execution lasts more than 4 micro-seconds.
-
-The use of IARB needs the SCSI_NCR_IARB_SUPPORT option to have been defined 
-at compile time and the 'iarb' boot option to have been set to a non zero 
-value at boot time. It is not that useful for real work, but can be used 
-to stress SCSI devices or for some applications that can gain advantage of 
-it. By the way, if you experience badnesses like 'unexpected disconnections', 
-'bad reselections', etc... when using IARB on heavy IO load, you should not 
-be surprised, because force-feeding anything and blocking its arse at the 
-same time cannot work for a long time. :-))
