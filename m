Would it be a less invasive audit to allow different mount namespaces
to have different rootfses?

Hence my argument for a new syscall or entirely new operation.
mount(2) and friends are way too multiplexed right now.  I just found
yet another security bug due to the insanely complicated semantics of
the vfs syscalls.  (Yes, a different one from the one yesterday.)

A new operation kills several birds with one stone.  It could look like:

int mntns_change_root(int dfd, const char *path, int flags);

return -EPERM if chrooted.  Returns -EINVAL if path (relative to dfd)
isn't a mountmount.  Otherwise it disconnects path from the existing
hierarchy, attaches a permanently-empty read-only rootfs under it,
makes it the root of the mntns, and does the root refs fixup.  The old
hierarchy gets thrown out.

Benefits:
 - Plausibly slightly faster.  (Especially if we add the trivial
optimization that, if the caller holds the only reference to the
mntns, then changing root refs can avoid the big loop, but maybe
pivot_root could do that, too.)
 - Sidesteps the whole rootfs mess.
 - Much easier to use than pivot_root.
 - No userspace breakage.

Heck, it could be even simpler: it could just unconditionally skip the
fs struct walk.  Just require callers to make sure that everyone else
chroots into the new root.

Systemd could use this, too.  If it wants to keep a reference to the
initramfs, it can use a file descriptor.
