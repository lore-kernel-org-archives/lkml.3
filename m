What about private file mappings?

Careful!  That function is deprecated in favor of vm_ops->name.

I think it might pay to add an explicit vm_op to authorize
duplication, especially for non-cow mappings.  IOW this kind of
extension seems quite magical for anything that doesn't have the
normal COW semantics, including for plain old read-only mappings.

I was referring to special mappings in the install_special_mapping
sense.  Those may or may not have VM_PFNMAP set.

If VM_DONTEXPAND blocks this new feature entirely, that's probably good.
