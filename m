Hello Doug,

In the scsi_debug driver scsi_remove_host() is called from inside the 
sdebug_driver_remove() callback function. Unless I have missed something 
it is not guaranteed that that callback function is invoked before 
unloading of the scsi_debug driver has finished. I think most of the 
code in sdebug_driver_remove() should be moved to sdebug_remove_adapter().

Bart.
