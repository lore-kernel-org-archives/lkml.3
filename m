Yes, you are right, there are page faults observed with perf. I
misunderstood page fault as copying pages between backing store and
physical memory.

I've tried this as well. mmap() performance improves but still not as
good as write().
I used the perf report to compare write() and mmap() applications. For
write() version, top of perf report shows as:
33.33%  __copy_user_nocache
4.72%    ext2_get_blocks
4.42%    mutex_unlock
3.59%    __find_get_block

which looks reasonable.

However, for mmap() version, the perf report looks strange:
94.98% libc-2.15.so       [.] 0x000000000014698d
2.25%   page_fault
0.18%   handle_mm_fault

I don't know what the first item is but it took the majority of cycles.

Yes, page faults cannot be avoided in this case as well.
