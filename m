Interesting. I always assumed 140... was block number.

I suspect something is wrong with the reporting. I got this in kernel log _while
running fsck_. fsck was clean (take a look in the original email). I got weird
report with fsck -c, it told me filesystem modified but I don't think I got bad
blocks there.

I believe my scripts are running fsck automatically, and yes, I rebooted a lot
in a last month. It _may_ be possible that last month this x60 had different hard drive,
and I copied it bit-by-bit.

SATA hdd, will get you exact data.

For last month? Various, 3.10 to 3.16-rc, mostly 3.15+.

Debian 6.

Crash in last month? Probably yes.

Just usual desktop / kernel development.

You'll get them.

Is it possible that my fsck is so old it does not clear this "filesystem
had error in past" flag? Because I strongly suspect I'll boot into
init=/bin/bash, run fsck, it will tell me "all clean", and the messages
will repeat in the middle of fsck run.

Best regards,
