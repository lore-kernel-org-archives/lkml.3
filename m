It's a matter of priorities. There are hundreds of potential security
holes turned up by scanners, 2,500+ filed bugs in kernel bugzilla alone.

Which matters more - fixing the bugs people hit or the ones that they
don't and which have a very high cost impact on other users ?

Yes. I believe the classic wording is "this problem has not been observed
in the field"

And then go and instrument whether its the bit instructions or the cache
misses ?


If there is a significant performance improvement by spacing the fields
carefully, and you don't have other ordering problems as a result
(remembering that the compiler has a lot of re-ordering options provided
the re-ordering cannot be observed)

If that's the case then fine - submit a patch with numbers and the fields
spaced and quote the performance data.
