This should be  a mpt2sas adapter
#lsmod|grep mpt
mptctl                 96789  0

The system has 12 sata disks. What else do you need? I am willing to
provide any details you want.

OK, so let me describe the situation here. This is one of our storage
system. So 12 2TB sata disk in one box, normally when one disk fails, we
just want to remove it from the system by *software*, and then continue
to use the 11 disks left. We have found that sometimes an unsuccessful
umount or some actions against this disk can lead to some bad
situation(Say some very high load because many processes are 'D'ed). So
ideally if we can remove this device successfully, all the ios to this
disk will fail and there will be no 'D' processes and the loadavg will
also be low.

We use CentOS6.2 and the kernel version is 2.6.32-220.23.1.
