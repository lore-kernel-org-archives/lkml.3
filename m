You are whitelisting SCSI commands so obviously the SCSI tree
and the patch spills over into the block tree.
Can't see much point in ack-ing the sg changes since most
of the action is at higher levels.

The question I have is what existing code will this change
break (and will I being getting emails from peeved
developers)?

Is 8 lines of documentation changes enough? My guess is
that SG_IO ioctl pass-through users will be tripped up
and it won't be obvious to them to look at
     Documentation/block/queue-sysfs.txt
for enlightenment; especially if they are using a char
device node from the bsg, sg or st drivers to issue SG_IO.
