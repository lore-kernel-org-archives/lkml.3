OK, I will try exactly this approach (hoping not to have misunderstood anything).
Here is, very briefly, the strategy I am thinking about:
1) In a first, only-destructive phase, bring CFQ back, more or less, to its state
at the time when BFQ was forked initially, and justify the removal of every heuristic
and improvement. Depending on how many patches come out during this phase,
possibly pack them into a first, separate patch series.
2) In a second, only-constructive phase: (a) turn the stripped-down version of CFQ into
a flat BFQ-v0, (b) turn the latter into BFQ-v0, and, finally, (c) progressively turn BFQ-v0
into the last version of BFQ, through the previously-submitted patches. Of course after
fixing and improving all the involved patches according to the suggestions and corrections
of Tejun.

I will wait shortly for a possible feedback on this proposal, and, then, if nothing has still to be
changed or refined, silently start the process.

Great, thanks. BTW, most of the ‘internal’ parameters inappropriately exposed by BFQ,
as noted by Tejun, were exposed just because we forgot to remove them while turning
the testing version of BFQ into the submitted one. Sorry about that.

Thanks,
Paolo
