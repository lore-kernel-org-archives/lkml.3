You should be able to avoid this by using FSCTL_SRV_COPYCHUNK_WRITE
instead of FSCTL_SRV_COPYCHUNK on the wire. The former doesn't require
read access on the target, while the latter does. See [MS-SMB2] 2.2.31
and smbtorture's copy_chunk_bad_access test.

Samba only supported FSCTL_SRV_COPYCHUNK until now, as that's what
Windows Server 2k12 uses for copies initiated by Explorer. I've just
sent out the trivial patches adding FSCTL_SRV_COPYCHUNK_WRITE support.

Cheers, David
