Been there, done that.  Have you read the commit messages *at all*?

Patch 2: "Right now, there is still just one bitmap and the mask is
ignored, so there is no semantic change yet".

Patch 3: "This patch already introduces some semantic change, albeit
very limited; [...] a few commands are now forbidden for devices of type
other than TYPE_ROM, where they are reserved or vendor-specific".

Perhaps you've missed that this is v2, not v27.  Tell me a place in the
original review where you've told me to split the series.

Sure.  Except I had sent it six months ago, and it lied unreviewed
despite your acks for two months.  It is in the archives waiting to be
picked up.

For example, WRITE SAME is used to discard blocks.  If a Linux guest
wants to discard blocks, it may send WRITE SAME.  If a disk advertises
support for WRITE SAME, it is not nice if WRITE SAME then fails because
of a stupid whitelist that was designed for CD-ROMs.

And another disk instead works because it uses UNMAP instead of WRITE
SAME.  It's a support nightmare, perhaps the cause is obvious to me by
the time it reaches me, but that takes time---which is wasted time for
everyone involved.

The others are not in v2, or are sent by udev, or were added to the
standard for a reason and applications are using them (e.g. COMPARE AND
WRITE).

Because the "count me out" knob needs privileges.  It opens up way, way
more than what these patches do.

And the frigging patch to make the whole whitelisting
userspace-configurable with finer-grain (but still with appropriate
capabilities) was nacked.  By you, for God's sake.

And then in v2 I stated that I removed some disk commands because of
discussion with you.  But of course you don't know, because you've not
read the damn commit messages.

Thankyouverymuch.  Perhaps you should have read the commit messages (oh
sorry, have I said it already?) and seen that it's not about commands
that seemed "right":

   Only commands that affect the medium are added.
   Commands that affect other state of the LUN are all privileged, with
   the sole exception of START STOP UNIT (which has always been
   allowed for all file descriptors.  I do not really agree with that
   and it's probably an artifact of when /dev/cdrom had
   r--r--r-- permissions, but I'm not trying to change that.

Guy, calm down.  We're two.
