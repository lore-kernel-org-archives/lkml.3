Ok, got it. So unified hierarchy will co-exist with other hierarchies
in the system.

I somehow had the impression that either one will have unified hierarchy
or will be multiple hierarchies. But one can't have both.

But looks like that you are targetting that one can have multiple
hierarchies. One of those will be unified hierarchy with new contstraints.
Other hierarchies can be old type hierarchies. Do I understand it right?

So you want all the debug knobs to be enabled by  DEBUG_BLK_CGROUP option as
well as using a kernel command line? But I thought that in general
people are not supposed to set CONFIG_DEBUG_BLK_CGROUP=y. It brings in
unnecessary overhead. Those who are doing development and trying to debug
things only those can enable above config option.

But anyway, I am fine with hiding these files behind a command line
parameter too.

Ok, that's fine. We can introduce it once somebody really needs it.

I think from a user's perspective it really matters. If I see two knobs
in a cgroup, say throttle.io_service_bytes and cfq.io_service_bytes, it
is much more intuitive.

So I feel that we should aim for having consistent names in CFQ and
throttling. If one understands one knob at one layer, it is intuitive
to figure out what same knob means at other layer.

And, thankfully, we have only two stats at throttling layer.

blkio.throttle.io_serviced
blkio.throttle.io_service_bytes

Though names are little longer, but they look fine to me. They are
intuitive. So I can't see a strong reason to change those names
at CFQ layer.

blkio.cfq.io_serviced
blkio.cfq.io_service_bytes

Instead of renaming throttling knob, I will prefer to keep new CFQ knob
names consistent with throttling names.
