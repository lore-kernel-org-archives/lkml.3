Um, I'm not sure you'll speed stuff up by doing this: have you seen what
bio_copy_kern() does?  it will allocate a page per iov entry (in this
case probably only a single entry) and copy the data into and out of
that page, so not only do we get the copy overhead. We also get page
allocation overheads instead of the small number of bytes we might need,
which could cause quite a stall in a low memory situation.

I'm not saying don't do it, I'm just saying think of the consequences
over the fiddle of doing a small kmalloc.

We cache the ones we care about, but we could always add more if there's
enough call, I suppose.
