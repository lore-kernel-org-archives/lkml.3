Vladimir pointed out that the generation was still needed, I added it
back and will submit version 2 after the lockless counters have been
sorted out.

Argh, I thought CSS_ONLINE was an artifact obsoleted by the
css_tryget_online() conversion.  That's quite the handgrenade.

Tejun, should maybe the iterators not return css before they have
CSS_ONLINE set?  It seems odd to have memcg reach into cgroup like
that to check if published objects are actually fully initialized.
Background is this patch:

commit d8ad30559715ce97afb7d1a93a12fd90e8fff312
Author: Hugh Dickins <hughd@google.com>

    mm/memcg: iteration skip memcgs not yet fully initialized
    
    It is surprising that the mem_cgroup iterator can return memcgs which
    have not yet been fully initialized.  By accident (or trial and error?)
    this appears not to present an actual problem; but it may be better to
    prevent such surprises, by skipping memcgs not yet online.

It's not about root or the newly stored memcg, it's that you might
read the position right before it's replaced and css_put(), at which
point the css_tryget() may fail and you have to reload the position.

I'll add a comment.
