That would be a bug, I think.  E.g. "man 3posix open":

	No  files  shall  be created or modified if the function returns
	-1.

Looking at the code...  See the references to FILE_CREATED in
atomic_open--looks like that's trying to prevent may_open from failing
in this case.

Looks to me like it would be a bug in either case.
