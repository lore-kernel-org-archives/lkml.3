It does?  Why?  What seems to happen is that you loop over all the pending
requests and call done for them.  The way SCSI handles done commands is that
it queues them to the softirq, so there doesn't look to be any real
unfairness problem here.

<yaniv> The unfairness is that currently the loop goes over the tags from 0
to NUTRS(i.e 31), and calls done() at this order, regardless of the
task_attribute they hold.
Also, the benefit in performance is that instead of going over NUTRS (32)
iteration, we simple call done() only for the exact of completed request
(and according to their task_attribute priority). 

Scenario: a new HEAD_OF_QUEUE request that is completed during the current
loop, will be served only in the next interrupt (since the DOORBELL will be
read again only in the next interrupt), and saying it is a high tag, it will
be completed lastly. This patch will fix it, as I see that.

Since we never use anything other than SIMPLE attributes, this rather looks
like a solution in search of a problem.
