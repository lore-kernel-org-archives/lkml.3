There is a USB host controller tunable for max number of sg entries
that's passed up to the SCSI or block layer.  We discussed changing it,
but there wasn't a good consensus on what to change it to:

http://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=138496358223904&w=2
http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&m=138496706007262&w=2

In the end, we thought we didn't need to limit the sglist size because
Paul thought usb-storage limits the overall transfer size to 120K, which
should fit in 31 TRBs:

http://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=138498190419312&w=2

Walt, could you see if limiting the sglist size helps, by setting
hcd->self.sg_tablesize in xhci.c to 31?
