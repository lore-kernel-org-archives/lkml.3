Yes, wl is the load weight of the task. But I don't understand why you
multiply it with the tg_runnable_contrib of the group you want to insert
it into. Since effective_load() is supposed to return the load change
caused by adding the task to the cpu it would make more sense if you
multiplied with the task runnable_avg_sum / runnable_avg_period of the
task in question.
