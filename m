On a quick skim, the server's READDIR responses look correct.  The entry
btrfs-20141216-fix-a-warning-of-qgroup-account-on-shared-extents.patch
is returned in frame 53 (with complete reassembled reply displayed by
wireshark in frame 63).

You could double-check for me--just run "wireshark nfs-server.pcap",
look for packets labeled "Reply ... READDIR", and expand out the READDIR
op and directory listing.  I don't see anything obviously wrong.

It's interesting that there's only one LOOKUP in the trace, for btrfs-20
(returning, not suprisingly, NFS4ERR_NOENT).  If the client failed to
parse that entry for some reason, then maybe in addition to getting the
filename wrong it also failed to get the attributes, triggering the
extra lookup/getattr.

I'm a little unclear: when you said "All this is on freshly baked
3.18.1", are you describing the client, or the server, or both?
