How does this manifest as a bug?

The discontinuity is in struct page arrays, which hardware doesn't care
about.  All we need is to get from struct page to the physical address
for programming the hardware, for which we use the sg_phys() inline
function.

Even given we have a two page physical contiguity at 0xdffff000 in your
example, the sg list entry contains a length of 8192 and a page_link of
0xc1e43fdc, which we transform to the correct physical address and
length.
