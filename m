+/*			Need for ARC MMU v2
+ *
+ * ARC700 MMU-v1 had a Joint-TLB for Code and Data and is 2 way set-assoc.
+ * For a memcpy operation with 3 players (src/dst/code) such that all 3 pages
+ * map into same set, there would be contention for the 2 ways causing severe
+ * Thrashing.
+ *
+ * Although J-TLB is 2 way set assoc, ARC700 caches J-TLB into uTLBS which has
+ * much higher associativity. u-D-TLB is 8 ways, u-I-TLB is 4 ways.
+ * Given this, the thrasing problem should never happen because once the 3
+ * J-TLB entries are created (even though 3rd will knock out one of the prev
+ * two), the u-D-TLB and u-I-TLB will have what is required to accomplish memcpy
+ *
+ * Yet we still see the Thrashing because a J-TLB Write cause flush of u-TLBs.
+ * This is a simple design for keeping them in sync. So what do we do?
+ * The solution which James came up was pretty neat. It utilised the assoc
+ * of uTLBs by not invalidating always but only when absolutely necessary.
+ *
+ * - Existing TLB commands work as before
+ * - New command (TLBWriteNI) for TLB write without clearing uTLBs
+ * - New command (TLBIVUTLB) to invalidate uTLBs.
+ *
+ * The uTLBs need only be invalidated when pages are being removed from the
+ * OS page table. If a 'victim' TLB entry is being overwritten in the main TLB
+ * as a result of a miss, the removed entry is still allowed to exist in the
+ * uTLBs as it is still valid and present in the OS page table. This allows the
+ * full associativity of the uTLBs to hide the limited associativity of the main
+ * TLB.
+ *
+ * During a miss handler, the new "TLBWriteNI" command is used to load
+ * entries without clearing the uTLBs.
+ *
+ * When the OS page table is updated, TLB entries that may be associated with a
+ * removed page are removed (flushed) from the TLB using TLBWrite. In this
+ * circumstance, the uTLBs must also be cleared. This is done by using the
+ * existing TLBWrite command. An explicit IVUTLB is also required for those
+ * corner cases when TLBWrite was not executed at all because the corresp
+ * J-TLB entry got evicted/replaced.
