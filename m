FWIW, I had posted similar macros for userland strcpy() and friends to
the security-audit list (now defunct) in 1998.  Someone preserved a copy
here (although the indentation is lost):

In (weird) use, with proper indentation:

Personally, I was using this at the time for building known-broken
software like wu-ftpd, where the risk of false positives felt lower than
the risk of buffer overflow bugs being in fact present in the code.

I used gcc's Statement Exprs extension, which is also used in the Linux
kernel a lot:

http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Statement-Exprs.html

So maybe you should, too.  (That is, if you want to go ahead with this
approach for code that isn't meant to be as broken as wu-ftpd was.)
This lets us propagate the original return value.

To determine the destination buffer size, I simply used sizeof() and
skipped my added protection in case the size looked like that of a
pointer.  Now you have those nice new gcc features instead. :-)

I guess the slowdown is mostly from the added strlen().  I avoided it by
using strncat(), so I had truncation instead of detection.  It is
unclear which is better.

Other functions I did this for are strcat(), sprintf(), vsprintf().
