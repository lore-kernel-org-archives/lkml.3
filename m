The misc_rtns_1 workload that I described here is just part of a larger 
workload involving other activities. It represents just 1/17 of the 
total jobs that were spawned. This particular job type, however, 
dominates the time because of the lock contention that it created. I 
agree that it is an artificial workload as most benchmarks are. It is 
certainly an exaggeration of what a real workload may be, but it doesn't 
mean that similar contention will not happen in the real world 
especially when the trend is to have more and more CPU cores packed in 
the same machine.
