Okay, I'm convinced.

So I suggest

 - mount(..., MNT_REFLINK): *allow* splice to reflink.  If this is not
set, fall back to page cache copy.
 - splice(... SPLICE_REFLINK):  fail non-reflink copy.  With this app
can force reflink.

Both are trivial to implement and make sure that no backward
incompatibility surprises happen.

My other worry is about interruptibility/restartability.  Ideas?

What happens on splice(from, to, 4G) and it's a non-reflink copy?
Can the page cache copy be made restartable?   Or should splice() be
allowed to return a short count?  What happens on (non-reflink) remote
copies and huge request sizes?

Thanks,
Miklos
