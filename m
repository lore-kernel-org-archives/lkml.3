Gah, I've got not idea what the hell I was smoking yesterday
afternoon. 0x2000 is actually ATTR_FILE, and 0x8000 is ATTR_OPEN.

So a mask of 0xa068 is correct and valid from the open path, and
0x2068 is just file from the truncate path.

But, neither of those should trigger that assert. indeed, on a test
kernel (3.10-rc2 based):

# echo I need a new drug > /mnt/scr/bah/blah/black/sheep/foo
[  296.742990] XFS (vdb): xfs_setattr_size: mask 0xa068, masked # 0x0 ii 0xffff88003e6297c0, d 0xffff88003e5b9cb0 path /bah/blah/black/sheep/foo
#

And there's not assert failure. Indeed, the "masked # 0x0" is what
the assert is checking.

And yeah, path output works. Trick for anyone who doesn't read the
code closely - the buffer is filled from the end backwards, and the
start of the path is the return variable. So, the above code is:

	{
		struct dentry *d = d_find_alias(VFS_I(ip));
		char buf[MAXPATHLEN];
		char *ptr;

		memset(buf, 0, MAXPATHLEN);
		ptr = dentry_path(d, buf, MAXPATHLEN);
		xfs_warn(mp, "%s: mask 0x%x, masked 0x%x ii 0x%p, d 0x%p path %s",
			__func__, mask,
	(mask & (ATTR_MODE|ATTR_UID|ATTR_GID|ATTR_ATIME|ATTR_ATIME_SET|
			ATTR_MTIME_SET|ATTR_KILL_SUID|ATTR_KILL_SGID|
			ATTR_KILL_PRIV|ATTR_TIMES_SET)),
			ip, d, ptr);
		dput(d);
	}

Which I put just before the assert that is firing on your machine.

And, obviously, it isn't firing on mine and obviously shouldn't be firing on a
mask of 0xa068.

Gah, what a mess. Sorry for the run-around, Dave, my brain clearly
wasn't working yesterday afternoon.

-Dave.
