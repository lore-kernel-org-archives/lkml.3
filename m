At least for code I maintain, I really wish people would just Cc me in
any case.  There's been a bunch of cases where people don't Cc me, and
then another maintainer assumes my silence implies agreement, and
applies.  Not nice. OTOH it's easy to ignore an irrelevant patch.

Yea, think about it, then what?  I've no idea what is linux-abi for, and
what people subscribed there are interested in. How should I? All I know
is what's in MAINTAINERS, which say "ABI/API". So I copy all ABI/API
patches there.
