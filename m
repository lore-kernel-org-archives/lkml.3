Um, sorry, forgot to make a tag.  Done now.

Well, yes, provided the new driver exception still holds.  The eas2r
driver was added in the last merge window so it qualifies.  Previously
you'd said that drivers that weren't previously in the tree could have
changes and cleanups added even at the -rc stage ... if you're reversing
this, I can pull the eas2r updates into the misc tree insead.

OK, so is the new driver exception gone then?
