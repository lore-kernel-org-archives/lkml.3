i think that an additional issue here is that part of reissuing the
ioctl is re-queueing the command. since the re-queue is at the front
of the block queue there are issues if the command is non-idempotent.

we have a local fix that gets rid of most of the orphan stuff and
re-waiting if a non-fatal signal was waiting. simpler than unmapping
but maybe we're missing some other interesting case?
