The host has to stop processing the transaction, it can't "wait" for the
transaction to finish.  "The Stop Endpoint Command is expected to stop
endpoint activity as soon as possible, which may mean that it stops in
the middle of a TRB."

Usually when hosts get into this kind of mode, something has seriously
gone wrong, like bus error when it issues a bad memory access.

You mean print the PCI device and vendor ID?  Perhaps Subsystem vendor
as well?

It would be appreciated if you could see if your device causes other
host controllers to fail.  Who am I to keep a geek from new toys? ;)

In the meantime, try this patch, which is something of a long shot.

Subject: [PATCH] xhci: Enable Link TRB quirk for 0.96 ASMedia host.

A recent bug fix commit causes an ASMedia host to stop responding to
commands.  See if it needs the link TRB quirk.  This was generally only
necessary for 0.95 hosts, but maybe this 0.96 host needs it.
