Yeah, I don't understand either.

Flock locks are owned by the file description. The task that set
them is really irrelevant once they are set.

In the second flock() call there, you're just "modifying" an existing
lock (which turns out to be a noop here).

So, I don't quite understand the problem this solves. I get that you're
trying to reestablish the flock "state" after a checkpoint/restore
event, but why does it matter what task actually sets the locks as long
as they're set on the correct set of fds?
