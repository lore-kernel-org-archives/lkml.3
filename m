Well???  I responded yesterday but I still don't see it on the list so
at the expense of some getting a double response I'll try again ...

Adam:

Thanks for looking/trying.

No, the closest to the above that I have access to is a NEC platform
with a PCI_VENDOR_ID_NCR vendor's PCI_DEVICE_ID_AMI_MEGARAID3 device.

I stumbled onto the issue because I want to get rid of the driver's use
of 'struct pci_dev'.  It seems, from my looking, to be the only driver
that keeps local copies of such, and upon further investigation I
noticed that the intended use of the local copies is flawed to the point
that keeping them makes no sense (which further supported my desire to
get rid of them).
