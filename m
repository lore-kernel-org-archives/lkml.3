Eric Biederman has always been adamantly opposed to adding new namespaces
of namespaces, so the fact that you're asking this question concerns me.

The way things are right now, since audit belongs to the init userns,
we can get away with saying if a container 'migrates', the new kernel
will see a different set of serials, and noone should care.  However,
if we're going to be allowing containers to have their own audit
namespace/layer/whatever, then this becomes more of a concern.

That said, I'll now look at the patches while pretending that problem
does not exist :)  If I ack, it'll be on correctness of the code, but
we'll still have to deal with this issue.
