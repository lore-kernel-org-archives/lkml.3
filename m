I've not been cc'd on any of those bugs internally at RH, so I don't
have visibility of the problems unless someone specifically adds me
to those bugs.  As it is, raising fedora/RHEL bugs is not informing
upstream - it is a distro process for tracking the distro issue
through to closure.

Ugh, no, I'm not going to subscribe to a high noise list where the
only way I might be informed of a CVE being raised is by following
links to git commit IDs....

Upstream is not magically informed about CVEs, and relying on
upstream developers to scan or poll *anything* just to find if a
CVE on their subsystem has been released is not reliable and
does not scale. If anyone raises a CVE against a kernel subsystem,
then the relevant list in the MAINTAINERS file for that subsystem
should be on the cc list of any discussion about the CVE, and on the
announcement of the CVE.

Security processes are not something that should be hidden away in
it's own private corner - if there's a problem upstream needs to
take action on, then direct contact with upstream is necessary. We
need to know about security issues - even ones that are classified
post-commit as security issues - so we are operating with full
knowledge of the issues in our code and the impact of our fixes....

Cheers,

Dave.
