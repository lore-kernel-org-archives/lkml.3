Well, this isn't reducing my confusion:  I think you're referring to
12-369r0 which proposes to *eliminate* the reference tag (by moving it
into the CRC calculation) and use the recovered 4 bytes to expand the
CRC to CRC32 and add two bytes to the application tag, so they both
become 4 bytes long, but the new PI still occupies only 8 bytes on disk.

Perhaps it's also better to clarify the terminology:  The PI is composed
of a Guard field, which is the checksum, an application tag, which is
usable by the application for anything it wants and a reference tag
which is designed to be derived from the on-disk location so it can be
used to detect misplaced writes.  In Type 1 the reference tag has to be
the lower 31 bits of the LBA and in type 3 it's application defined.  In
all current types, the guard is two bytes and the application tag two
bytes.
