reverting your commit 045065d8a300a37218c is a solution, but it's just a
temporary solution,

it's better to search why your commit can create a random hang on boot
on some PC configurations,

--- a/drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c
+++ b/drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c
@@ -1774,7 +1774,7 @@ static void scsi_request_fn(struct request_queue *q)
blk_requeue_request(q, req);
atomic_dec(&sdev->device_busy);
out_delay:
- if (atomic_read(&sdev->device_busy) && !scsi_device_blocked(sdev))
+ if (!atomic_read(&sdev->device_busy) && !scsi_device_blocked(sdev))
blk_delay_queue(q, SCSI_QUEUE_DELAY);
}

perhaps the atomic_read() function doesn't make the expected job on some
rare circonstances, I have the same doubts about the blk_delay_queue()
function
