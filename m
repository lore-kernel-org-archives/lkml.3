I am happy that these drew attention from somebody Atleast :)

I couldn't understand why we went via a interrupt here ? Probably CPU1
was idle and was woken up with a IPI and then this happened. But in
that case too,
shouldn't the script run from process context instead ?

There are very few changes in between 3.10 and latest for timers/hrtimers
and so things are expected to be the same.

Okay, just to let you know, I have also found some issues and they are
now pushed in my tree.. Also it is rebased over 3.15-rc2 now.

How exactly?

I can't keep it as a separate patch and so would be required to merge
it into my original patch..

Thanks for your inputs :)
