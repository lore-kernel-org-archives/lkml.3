You would have to get the IETF’s NFSv4 working group to sign off on
this change. Otherwise, Linux would be the only NFSv3 implementation
that supports the extension.

But I suspect the answer you’d get is “Use NFSv4.”

There’s no reliable way in NFSv3 for clients and servers to identify
the software running on the peer.

Practically speaking, you should assume that the NFSv3 protocol is never
going to change.
