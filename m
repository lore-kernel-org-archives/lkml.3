As its designed right now no, its not a temp tool, its there to
require compatibility with old userspace. For modules we can require
the module parameter but for built-in we need something else and this
is what came to mind. It is also what would allow the prefer_async_probe
flag too as otherwise we won't know if userspace is prepared.

If we want to get rid of it, it would mean that we're letting go of the idea
that some userspace might exist which depends on *not* doing async probe. As
such I would not consider it a __DEVEL__ param and it'd be a judgement call
to eventually *not require* it. I can see that happening but perhaps a large
series of kernels down the road?
