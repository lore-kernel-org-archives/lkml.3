Let me add some caveats to explain what is used, as the 2 cases map to
the 2 different new options.

In here the logging system wants to know *who* logged, if the cgroups of
the process actually doing the logging changes, that's what the logging
system wants to know.
If somehow a setuid binary can change the cgroups, then the logging
system *wants* to know that these logs are coming from there, because
they sure are not coming from the original bounded process anymore.

This use case wants to use SO_PASSCGROUP as it wants to know who the
current writer is, not who opened the file descriptor.

This case is the inverse, we totally want to care only about who
*opened* the socket for communication, because that's when the kernel
does access control and tells us who is the *owner* of the information.
It doesn't matter at all if the owner turns around and passes the socket
to another process anywhere in the system. If that process does it, it
means it wants to disclose information to which it already have access
to and can ship to said process already and independently anyway.

This use case wants to use SO_PEERCGROUP for that reason.

I hope this makes the use cases more clear.

Simo.
