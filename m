Looking at more examples, some of which are much larger match tables
maybe it has to do with how the final entry is defined.  In this
example the NULL match is explicitly stated.

static const match_table_t cifs_secflavor_tokens = {
    { Opt_sec_krb5, "krb5" },
    { Opt_sec_krb5i, "krb5i" },
    { Opt_sec_krb5p, "krb5p" },
    { Opt_sec_ntlmsspi, "ntlmsspi" },
    { Opt_sec_ntlmssp, "ntlmssp" },
    { Opt_ntlm, "ntlm" },
    { Opt_sec_ntlmi, "ntlmi" },
    { Opt_sec_ntlmv2, "nontlm" },
    { Opt_sec_ntlmv2, "ntlmv2" },
    { Opt_sec_ntlmv2i, "ntlmv2i" },
    { Opt_sec_lanman, "lanman" },
    { Opt_sec_none, "none" },

    { Opt_sec_err, NULL }
};
