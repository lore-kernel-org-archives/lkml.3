Well, maybe the history of it being a prctl() should count for something.
Most likely, userland will need to test for whether or not these
features are present in the kernel for years to come. With a syscall,
it would now require a syscall (unlikely to be in older headers for a
while, so will require using syscall(3) for a bit) as well as a call
to prctl() to test for seccomp mode 2 (without thread sync) in the
fallback path. It'll be a little odd. As the person who will make this
work in Chromium, I do not feel strongly either way, it's a detail, so
feel free to disregard this point.

But I'm eagerly waiting for:
- Not having to test for the presence of threads at run-time (which
requires a very ugly busy loop with exponential back-off watching for
/proc/self/tasks/ to drop to 1 directory entry).
- Being able to engage the sandbox after third-party libraries have
started threads.
