I'm not sure that's right.  scsi_debug uses the driver mode in a
slightly unusual way, and includes both the bus driver, device and
device driver.

sdebug_driver_remove is a bus method, but as we don't have driver methods
should act very much like all other _remove callbacks.

sdebug_remove_adapter is more a "bus-level" function that calls into
the driver model to unbind devices from the driver.

But we defintively shouldn't stop and free queued command before we
fully remove the hosts.  As far as I can tell the stop_all_queued
call can be entirely removed from the remove path, as the midlayer
will take care of waiting for all commands to return, and the
free_all_queued should be after all hosts are unregistered.

Something like the (untested) patch below would do the trick.
We'd still need Dougs patch for the EH case, though.
