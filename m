Hi,

GFS2 uses deferred locks, at the very least in its direct_io path
(gfs2_direct_IO in aops.c). So AFAIK we can't remove THAT without a certain
amount of pain. Steve is on vacation / holiday this week, but he will
be back on Thursday and Friday (which is a holiday).

I'm all for getting rid of useless parameters, and I've done so on
several occasions in GFS2.
