In order for compression to be a net win an application should be aware of what is being compressed and what isn't. For example patterns for IO on large libraries (eg 30mb libxul.so) are well suited to compression, but SQLite databases are not.  Similarly for our disk cache: images should not be compressed, but javascript should be. Footprint wins are useful on android, but it's the increased IO throughput on crappy storage devices that makes this most attractive.

If I understand the idea correctly, you want to have file-oriented
compression. I mean that you want to have one type of files are
compressed but another type of ones should be not compressed. So, from
my understanding, a file is not ext4 specific concept. Every filesystem
contains files. So, if you intend to implement compression support in
ext4 then you need to use e2compr as basis for full-featured compression
in ext4. But if you want to have something like file-oriented
compression then it is not feature of concrete filesystem. Do you mean
that Firefox will work only on ext4? So, it means for me that feature
likewise file-oriented compression should be on VFS level or over VFS.
And I am not fully confident that it should be a feature in
kernel-space.

Anyway, HFS+ keeps compressed files' content in com.apple.decmpfs xattr
or in resource fork. It means for me that HFS+ volume layout has special
metadata structures for compression support. Because if you will try to
work with HFS+ compressed file under Linux then you will see file with
zero byte in size. And, moreover, Mac OS X filesystem driver should know
about these metadata structures. Otherwise, it cannot process HFS+
compressed files. We can discuss about HFS+ compression in more details
but I think that it is not key topic for this patch set.

With the best regards,
