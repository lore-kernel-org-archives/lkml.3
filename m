Subject: [PATCH] scsi: Remove some false sharing in Scsi_Host / Scsi_Device
Date: Fri, 11 Jul 2014 13:25:10 -0700

From: Andi Kleen <ak@linux.intel.com>

These data structures are accessed by different CPUs and have some
fields which are mostly read only and others which are frequently
written. Separate some common ones into separate cache line
to minimize false sharing while submitting a command.

This allows scsi_dispatch_cmd to do more work with shared clean
cache lines.

- Move the cmd_serial_number to the end before the host data
- Separate write common fields from read mostly fields in
the scsi device
