Ok. So we are talking about generic approach to UMH support in a container (and/or namespace).

Actually, as far as I can see, there are more that one aspect, which is not supported.
One one them is executing of the right binary. Another one is capabilities (and maybe there are more, like user namespaces), but I don't really care about them 
for now.
Executing the right binary, actually, is not about namespaces at all. This is about lookup implementation in VFS (do_execve_common).

Would be great to unshare FS for forked UHM kthread and swap it to desired root. This will solve the problem with proper lookup. However, as far as I 
understand, this approach is not welcome by the community.

This problem, probably, can be solved by constructing full binary path (i.e. not in a container, but in kernel thread root context) in UMH "init" callack. 
However, this will help only is the dentry is accessible from "init" root. Which is usually no true in case on mount namespaces, if I understand them right.
