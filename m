It is normally safe for direct reclaim to enter filesystems
even when a page is locked - as can happen if ->writepage
allocates memory with GFP_KERNEL (which xfs does).

However if a localhost NFS mount is present, then a flush-*
thread might hold a page locked and then in direct reclaim,
ask nfs to commit an inode (nfs_release_page).  When nfsd
performs the fsync it might try to lock the same page, which leads to
a deadlock.

A ->writepage should not allocate much memory, or do so very often, so
it is safe to set PF_FSTRANS, and this removes the possible deadlock.

This was not detected by lockdep as it doesn't monitor the page lock.
It was found as a real deadlock in testing.
