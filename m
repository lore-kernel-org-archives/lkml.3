Can you triple-check the inode size on your fs, for good measure?

dumpe2fs -h /dev/whatever | grep "Inode size"

turns out it's not a problem, it's an undocumented & surprising "feature."  :(

        /* For inline data all offsets should be in bytes, not blocks */
        if (fm_extent->fe_flags & FIEMAP_EXTENT_DATA_INLINE)
                blk_shift = 0;

because ... ?  (the commit which added it didn't mention anything about it).

But I guess it does mean for at least those files, the xattr data is actually inline.

Sorry we got so far off the thread of the original patches.

But it seems like a mystery worth solving.

Perhaps in ext4_xattr_set_handle() you can instrument the case(s) where it
gets into ext4_xattr_block_set().

Or most simply, just printk inode number in ext4_xattr_block_set() so
you can look at them later via debugfs.

And in here,

        } else {
                error = ext4_xattr_ibody_set(handle, inode, &i, &is);
                if (!error && !bs.s.not_found) {
                        i.value = NULL;
                        error = ext4_xattr_block_set(handle, inode, &i, &bs);
                } else if (error == -ENOSPC) {
                        if (EXT4_I(inode)->i_file_acl && !bs.s.base) {
                                error = ext4_xattr_block_find(inode, &i, &bs);
                                if (error)
                                        goto cleanup;
                        }
                        error = ext4_xattr_block_set(handle, inode, &i, &bs);

maybe print out in the ext4_xattr_ibody_set error case what the size of
of the xattr is, and probably inode number again for good measure, to get
an idea of what's causing it to fail to land in the inode?
