This test^ is most likely useless, it looks like you set the
ACB_F_MESSAGE_WQBUFFER_CLEARED every time you have added some data to the buffer
and clear it when the buffer gets empty. I think you could get rid of
the ACB_F_MESSAGE_WQBUFFER_CLEARED completely. Also the ACB_F_MESSAGE_RQBUFFER_CLEARED doesn't
seems to be ever evaluated.
I'm not sure with the ACB_F_MESSAGE_WQBUFFER_READED, but that one probably is also
a candidate for removal.

What is the reason for using an exact size int32 (instead of a plain int) here?

The comments I've added are not directly related to this patch,
but you may still address them in a new patch
so -
