Subject: [PATCH 25/33] blk-throttle: dispatch from throtl_pending_timer_fn()
Date: Mon,  6 May 2013 15:46:04 -0700

Currently, blk_throtl_dispatch_work_fn() is responsible for both
dispatching bio's from throtl_grp's according to their limits and then
issuing the dispatched bios.

This patch moves the dispatch part to throtl_pending_timer_fn() so
that the work item is kicked iff there are bio's to issue.  This is to
avoid work item execution at each step when hierarchy support is
enabled.  bio's will be dispatched towards the top-level service_queue
from the timers at each layer and the work item will only be used to
issue the bio's which reached the top-level service_queue.

While fetching bio's to issue from bio_lists[],
blk_throtl_dispatch_work_fn() fetches all READs before WRITEs.  While
the original code also dispatched READs first, if multiple throtl_grps
are dispatched on the same run, WRITEs from throtl_grp which is
dispatched first would precede READs from throtl_grps which are
dispatched later.  While this is a behavior change, given that the
previous code already prioritized READs and block layer generally
prioritizes and segregates READs from WRITEs, this isn't likely to
make any noticeable differences.
