How did I know you'd take that cheap shot, Mikulas? You are so
predictable...

Which is a problem with memory corruption after filling a dm
snapshot volume to 100% and shortly after XFS has shut down the
kernel panics from memory corruption. Can't be reproduced without
filling the dm-snapshot volume to 100%, can't be reproduced with any
other filesystem. Crashes are also occurring randomly in printk and
the worker thread infrastructure. Memory and list poisoning clearly
indicates worker thread lists have freed objects on them. There are
lockdep messages from the DM snapshot code, etc.

There's actually very little to point at XFS problems other than the
first hang that was reported where XFS was stuck in a tight loop due
to memory corruption.  It reminds me of a very similar bug report
and triage we went through last week:

http://oss.sgi.com/pipermail/xfs/2013-October/030681.html

Further analysis and bisects pointed to the zram driver being buggy,
not XFS:

http://oss.sgi.com/pipermail/xfs/2013-October/030707.html

XFS has historically exposing bugs in block device drivers that no
other filesystem exposes, and so when a new block device driver gets
tested with XFS and we start seeing memory corruption symptoms, it's
a fair bet that it's not XFS that is causing it....

Just sayin'.

Akira, can you please post the entire set of messages you are
getting when XFS showing problems? That way I can try to confirm
whether it's a regression in XFS or something else.

Cheers,

Dave.
