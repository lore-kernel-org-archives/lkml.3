Mostly good.

I'm just a little concerned about "if the client loses contact with the
server" in the middle there.  It is no longer qualified and it isn't clear
that the "for a period of time" qualification still applied.  And we should
probably quantify the period of time - which defaults to 90 seconds.
I don't remember just now the difference between
   /proc/fs/nfsd/nfsv4{lease,grace}time
but this 90 seconds is one of those.

Also this is NFSv4 specific.  With NFSv3 the failure mode is the reverse.  =
If
the server loses contact with a client then any lock stays in place
indefinitely ("why can't I read my mail"... I remember it well).

  Before Linux 3.12, if an NFSv4 client loses contact with the server
  (defined as more than 90 seconds with no communication), it might lose
  and regain ....

Just changing that bit should cover it I think.
