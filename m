This would make things more consistent with mount, and easier! The 
reason to keep it the way it is is for consistency with NFS and DHCP 
option 17.

NFS concatenates the options in DHCP root-path (option 17) with the ones 
placed on the kernel command line. We could separate out the device and 
path strings from the options, but they would still be merged together 
in the DHCP string. Some parsing would still be required to split the 
DHCP string and merge with command line options. I'd prefer to keep them 
together on the command line also, just to have things stay similar to NFS.

Thanks
