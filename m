Userspace should be able to deal with however cgroups are mounted for
it.  The only case I've heard of where it really made a meaningful
difference was google's advanced grid usage.  In fact, the whole
justification of the unified cgroup stuff was that it was claimed (and
argued against by google) that that sufficed for any users.

Now yes, until now userspace could cache its info on how cgroups were
mounted and assume that wouldn't change (because the kernel wouldn't
let it), and migration will break that.  But if the cgroup roadmap
is to obsolete anything but unified hierarchy, then this was going
to happen regardless of what the cgroupns patchset did.

I agree with Aditya.  So long as the proclaimed direction of cgroups is
to only support unified cgroup hierarchy, there's no point in having
cgroupns do anything more than the chrooting.

Well, google does.  There are cases that were either much more complicated
or impossible to represent with unified hierarchy.  But complicating cgroupns
to support something which Tejun has said is explicitly not going to be
supported in the future would be ill-advised.

No, my reading of Documentation/cgroups/unified-hierarchy.txt is that
unified hierarchy means that all (sane) controllers are co-mounted into
one hierarchy.
