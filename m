The sg driver won't object.  The lock is taken again and released
during sg_open and sg_release, which are guranteed not to migrate
to a different process during their run time.

mutex_init/mutex_lock/mutex_unlock from <linux/mutex.h>

I don't think that sg_remove can be called from irq context.
It always is called through the class interface remove_dev
method, which always is called under a lock.

I would suggest to remove the list lock and only use the or_sem
replacement.

How about we get that fixed first?
