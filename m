I have to say that 3d08bcc887 ("mm: Wait for writeback when grabbing
pages to begin a write") was a massive faceplant.  How the heck did that
happen?

Looking back at the 19 May 2011 patchset, I see that we all managed to
avoid cc'ing the guy who wrote and designed that code and who introduced
the PageWriteback/wait_on_page_writeback() infrastructure to avoid exactly
the problem which 3d08bcc887 added.  Sigh.

This patchset lacks any performance testing results.


The patchset looks OK to me, but one thing I find unclear:

For clarity's sake, please provide a description of which filesystems
(and under which circumstances) will block behind writeback when
userspace is attempting to dirty a page.  Both before and, particularly,
after this patchset.  IOW, did everything get fixed?
