So what you suggested is actually what we did in order to prove that this was
what the problem was.  I'm ok with continuing to do that, I just figured adding
something like rwsem_is_contended() would be nice in case anybody else runs into
the issue in the future, plus it would save me an atomic_t in an already large
structure.  Thanks,

Josef
