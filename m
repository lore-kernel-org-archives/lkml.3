The steps I used are:

Download mmtests: https://github.com/gormanm/mmtests.git

cp configs/config-global-dhp__reaim-io config

edit the new config and just leave 'workfile.shared workfile.disk'
workloads as the REAIM_WORKFILES parameter.

./run-mmtests --no-monitor testname

Just a few mins into the test you should start getting the lockups. fwiw
I have not had the time to try other setups of reaim that are not
bundled with mmtests.

Thanks,
Davidlohr
