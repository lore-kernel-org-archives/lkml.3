.update_time is used for the atime update as well, and it relies on
the core code to update the in-memory timestamp first.  I used that
approach in v2, but it was (correctly, I think) pointed out that this
was a layering violation and that core code shouldn't be mucking with
the timestamps directly during writeback.

There was a recent effort to move most of the file_update_calls from
the core into .page_mkwrite, and I don't think anyone wants to undo
that.

The problem with only doing it in ->writepages is that calling
writepages from munmap and exit would probably hurt performance for no
particular gain.  So I need some kind of callback to say "update the
time, but don't write data."  The AS_CMTIME bit will still be set when
the ptes are removed.

I could require ->writepages *and* ->flush_cmtime to handle the time
update, but that would complicate non-transactional filesystems.
Those filesystems should just flush cmtime at the end of writepages.

This is already possible although not IMO necessary for correctness.
All that ext4 would need to do is to add something like:

if (mapping_test_clear_cmtime(mapping)) {
  update times within current transaction
}

somewhere inside the transaction in writepages.  There would probably
be room for some kind of generic helper to do everything in
inode_update_time_writable except for the actual mark_inode_dirty
part, but this still seems nasty from a locking perspective, and I'd
rather leave that optimization to an ext4 developer who wants to do
it.

I could simplify this a bit by moving the mapping_test_clear_cmtime
part from .flush_cmtime to its callers.
