Thanks.

Fair enough.  Though to be precise, this is a combined patchset also
because previous attempts to get similar patches reviewed proceeded with
glacial pace.

For example, the unpriv_sgio patch had been sent in November 2012
(https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/1735871/).  It got two acks from
Tejun, and was never applied despite two pings.

My attempt to include UNMAP and WRITE SAME into the whitelist (even before
I found out by chance the overlap) dates back to July 2012, and was only
reviewed two months after.

No, you don't need to.  Just read the commit message of patch 4.

This doesn't look advisory to me:

$ sudo chmod 444 /dev/sdb
$ sha1sum /dev/sdb
e15720aa0d26856f0486867634b6737c30ea7346  /dev/sdb
$ echo -n $'%\x16%\x10%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\x40%%%%%' | tr % \\0 | \
     sg_raw  --readonly /dev/sdb -s24 42 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 18 00
$ sha1sum /dev/sdb
aab335ccc669bbbc85d727870b5941dc3581f025  /dev/sdb

It doesn't look readonly, either.

That was introduced because Tejun didn't want to enable more than the bare
minimum for MMC devices.  He was worried about hypothetical scenarios with
vendors recycling opcodes in a way that is not suitable for exposing to
unprivileged userland (he reinforced this, for example, here:
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1429863).

Not true.  Each patch can be reviewed independently.  The big and hard-to-
review movement is all in patch 2.

The next patches can be tedious to review, but that does not meen hard.  Just
do "grep ^[-+].*sgio_bitmap_set patchNN | sort -k2 -k1" for example

It was, and it was ignored.  I sent it together because of the common
dependency on the first patch.

However, it is not the only feature I need; that patch should be just for things
like reservations or vendor-specific commands.  I also need that SG_IO works
well without any privileges, neither CAP_SYS_RAWIO (needed for a process to
bypass the whitelist) neither CAP_SYS_ADMIN (needed for a process to disable
the whitelist for others as in patch 13/14).  I need that at least for disks,
tapes and media changers.
