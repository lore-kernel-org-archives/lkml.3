libata exception handling which includes probing doesn't go through
SCSI at all.  It all works inside libata proper using ata_queuecmds
and only the result is exposed to SCSI.  Most of those SCSI semantics
need to be emulated anyway, so this makes things a lot easier than
going through SCSI for each command.  As it currently stands, it'd be
a lot of effort to try to embed ata_qc's into higher layer construct.
Given how it's used, I don't think it's a high priority task.

One thing which would probably be worthwhile tho is getting rid of the
bitmap based qc tag allocator in libata.  That one is just borderline
stupid to keep around on any setup which is supposed to be scalable.

Thanks.
