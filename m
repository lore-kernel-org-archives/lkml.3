Hello, Jeff.

The latency is prolly from concurrency management.  Work items which
participate in concurrency management (the ones on per-cpu workqueues
w/o WQ_CPU_INTENSIVE set) tend to get penalized on latency side quite
a bit as the "run" durations for all such work items end up being
serialized on the cpu.  Setting WQ_CPU_INTENSIVE on the workqueue
disables concurrency management and so does making the workqueue
unbound.  If strict cpu locality is likely to be beneficial and each
work item isn't likely to consume huge amount of cpu cycles,
WQ_CPU_INTENSIVE would fit better; otherwise, WQ_UNBOUND to let the
scheduler do its thing.

Thanks.
