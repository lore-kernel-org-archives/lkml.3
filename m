  It was discussed at linux-ext4 / linux-fsdevel sometime in spring but I'm
not sure to which extent we covered details of the races. Anyway if you
have blocks in pagecache which point to already freed blocks (lets say they
belong to file foo), the following
can happen:
  1) Someone reallocates freed blocks for another file bar. And writes new
     data to them. Writeback flushes the data to disk.
  2) Someone dirties pages with stale mapping data in file foo.
  3) Writeback writes dirty pages of foo, overwriting data in bar.

  IMHO these are different aspects of the same problem but that's not
important. Your patch actually makes things worse because currently if the
file isn't written to via mmap while punch_hole is running, everything is
fine. After your patch writeback of old data could race with punch hole
freeing blocks resulting in data corruption I have described above. The
'no-harm' solution would be to add another truncation of pagecache after
punch hole is done. I think that would be a good way to reduce the race
window before the problem gets fixed properly.
