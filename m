  Memory stick or your root disk, the application will get EIO in both
cases. Userspace cannot umount the disk until all applications using the
disk close their file descriptors. So there is no difference AFAICS.

So which better means do you have in mind to communicate root disk
filesystem is having problems? You could have a system like nagios monitor
whether the system is alive but then you don't need to bother with kernel
messages at all.

  Well, my current opinion is that although in some cases having the
messages KERN_EMERG doesn't make sense, in other case it makes sense. So I
don't feel a strong reason to change what we have.

OTOH I wonder if that particular message in log_wait_commit() is useful
at all. The journal is aborted but we already informed user about that when
aborting it so there's no good reason to spam logs with information the
journal is still aborted... So I guess I'll just remove the message and we
will be both happy :)
