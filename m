Thanks for explaining more, I was just about to acknowledge what a good
example that is.  Indeed, it seems not unreasonable to be editing the
earlier part of a file while the later part of it is still streaming in.

But damn, it now occurs to me that there's still a problem at the
streaming end: its file write offset won't be updated to reflect
the collapse, so there would be a sparse hole at that end.  And
collapse returns -EPERM if IS_APPEND(inode).

Never mind, I'm not campaigning for a change of interface anyway.
