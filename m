No, the reason bufferheads were replaced was that a bufferhead can
only reference a single page. i.e. the structure is that a page can
reference multipl bufferheads (block size >= page size) but a
bufferhead can't refernce multiple pages which is what is needed for
block size > page size. fsblock was designed to handle both cases.

Dave.
