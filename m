Dave is on the other side of the international date line from those of
us in the States.  If my time zone math is correct, this thread began
and continued *after* the end of his 'normal' Friday workday, during
Dave's weekend.  You think it might be possible he decided to unplug and
actually live for a couple of days?

Put this on hold until Monday.
