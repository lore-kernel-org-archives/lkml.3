This is a significant enough issue that I posted it to oss-security:

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/11/17/19

It's not at all obvious to me how to fix it.  We could disallow userns
creation of any supplementary groups don't match fsuid, or we could
keep negative-only groups around in the userns.

It may be worth adding a sysctl to change the behavior, too.  IMO it's
absurd to use groups to deny permissions that are otherwise available.
