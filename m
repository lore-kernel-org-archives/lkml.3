There's lots of individual checks here. Let's separate them out
logically. Firstly, "Collapse range can only be used exclusively" is
a mode parameter check, and so should be done directly after
validating the mode only contains known commands. i.e. in the first
hunk above.

Secondly, "Collapse range works only on fs block size aligned
offsets" is an implementation constraint, not an API constraint.
i.e. There is no reason why a filesystem can't implement byte range
granularity for this operation, it just may not be efficient for all
fielsystems and so they don't choose to implement byte range
granularity. Further, filesystems might have different allocation
constraints than the filesystem block size (think bigalloc on ext4,
per-file extent size hints for XFS), and these generally aren't
reflected in inode->i_blkbits. In these cases, the granularity of
the collapse operation can only be determined by the filesystem
itself, not this high level code.

Hence I think the granularity check should be put into a helper
function that the filesystem's ->fallocate() method calls if it can
only support fs block aligned operations. That allows each
filesystem to determine it's own constraints on a per-operation
basis.

All that remains here is the "within file size"
check, and that doesn't need to be rounded up to block size to check
if it is valid. If the range given overlaps the end of file in any
way, then it is a truncate operation....

Hmmm - you're describing an implementation, not the API. i.e. what
you need to describe is the functionality users are provided with by
the flag and it's usage constraints, not how filesystems need to
implement it. Something like:

"FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE is used to remove a range of a file
without leaving a hole in the file. The contents of the file beyond
the range being removed is appended to the start offset of the range
being removed (i.e. the hole that was punched is "collapsed"),
resulting in a file layout that looks like the range that was
removed never existed. As suchm collapsing a range of a file changes
the size of the file, reducing it by the same length of the range
that has been removed by the operation.

Different filesystems may implement different limitations on the
granularity of the operation. Most will limit operations to
filesystem block size boundaries, but this boundary may be larger or
smaller depending on the filesystem and/or the configuration of the
filesystem or file.

Attempting to collapse a range that crosses the end of the file is
considered an illegal operation - just use ftruncate(2) if you need
to collapse a range that crosses EOF."

> +#define FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE	0x08 /* it does not leave a hole */

With the large descriptive comment, there is no need for the
appended "/* it does not leave a hole */" comment.

Cheers,

Dave.
