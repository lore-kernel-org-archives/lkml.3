OK, good to know.  ;-)

Exactly!

I should also add that smp_mb__before_spinlock() implies smp_wmb(), but
nothing more.  But that is OK because smp_wmb() suffices in this case.

Code making direct use of smp_read_barrier_depends() is harder to read,
in my experience, but good point on the sparse noise.  Maybe a new
lockless_dereference() primitive?  Maybe something like the following?
(Untested, probably does not even build.)

#define lockless_dereference(p) \
({ \
	typeof(*p) *_________p1 = ACCESS_ONCE(p); \
	smp_read_barrier_depends(); /* Dependency order vs. p above. */ \
	_________p1; \
})
