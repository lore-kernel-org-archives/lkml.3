What Peter said.  I would ask for suggestions for better wording, but
I would much rather be able to say that single-byte reads and writes
are atomic and that aligned-short reads and writes are also atomic.

Thus far, it looks like we lose only very old Alpha systems, so unless
I hear otherwise, I update my patch to outlaw these very old systems.

						Thanx, Paul
