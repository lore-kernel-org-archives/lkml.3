XFS shuts down because you've returned EIO to a log IO. That's a
fatal error. If you do the same to an ext4 journal write, it will do
the equivalent of shut down (e.g. complain and turn read-only).

What happened before this? Please attach the *full* log.

These should be emitting a stack trace. Can you turn up the logging
level you are using so that they emit a full stack trace? The
messages are useless without the stack dump....

Also, 23 seconds before this timestamp is 149s, about 3s after the
XFS filesystem shut down, so it's not clear that the XFS shutdown is
related to the soft lockup yet. That's what we need the stack traces
for...

What's with the 35s delay between these writeboost messages? Have
you only done a partial shutdown of the block device and it takes
This length of time for it to completely block IO?

Cheers,

Dave.
