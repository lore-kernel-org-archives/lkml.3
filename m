Yes, but unfortunately only in our internal bugzilla.

It's a customer-reported issue, so I am gathering permission to make this 
information public (I don't think that'll be an issue).

I'll send up a followup afterwards.

I have tried it, but it still doesn't work. It seems like the device 
initialization is not finalized properly with MISs disabled; meaning the 
device is there (discovery has completed), but it "just doesn't work".

Will be hopefully part of the dmesg I will be providing later ... 
basically any commands sent to it time out.
