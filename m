Sorry, I described the obviously broken scenario incorrectly.  Your
patch breaks (in the absence of things like selinux) if a exec
something setuid root.

Which has nothing to do with anything.  If that check fails, you're
just going on to a different, WRONG check/.

IMO yuck.

NAK.  You need to actually call the LSM.  What if the reason to fail
the request isn't that the writer gained capabilities -- what if the
writer's selinux label changed?

NO.  This is getting ridiculous.  You can't just re-implement what the
commoncap code does because you don't want to call the LSM hook.  You
need to call the LSM hook.

Yes.  But they're messy, they open-code incorrect checks, and they are
sufficiently incomplete as fixes for the vulnerability that you're
better off not doing them, because they'll just muddy the waters.

Yes, I was.  That particular thing is fine, because there's no LSM
hook involved in the first case.  If anyone ever adds one, they'll
have to invoke it in the appropriate places.
