Thanks for reviewing, James.

Originally, I planned that once the retry count exceeds its limit,
a monitoring tool stops the server with the scsi prink error message
as a trigger.
Current failfast mode implementation is that the command fails when
retry command exceeds its limit. However, I noticed that only printing error messages
on retry counts excess without changing retry logic will be enough
to stop the server and take fail over.  Though there is no guarantee that
userspace application can work properly on disk failure condition.
So, now I'm considering that just calling panic() on retry excess is better.

For that reason, I propose the solution that adding "panic_on_error" option to
sysfs parameter and if panic_on_error mode is enabled the server panics
immediately once it detects retry excess. Of course, it is disabled on default.

I would appreciate it if you could give me some comments.
