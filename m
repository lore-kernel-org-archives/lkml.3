Sorry, I misremembered how some of the XFS open-by-handle code works
in userspace (XFS has a pretty rich open-by-handle ioctl() interface
that predates the kernel syscalls by at least 10 years).  Basically
there is code in userspace that uses the information returned from
bulkstat to construct file handles to pass to the open-by-handle
ioctls. xfs_fsr then uses the combination of open-by-handle from the
bulkstat output and the bulkstat output to feed into the swap extent
ioctls....

i.e. the filesystem's idea of what time is is passed to userspace as
an opaque cookie in this case, but it is not used directly by the
open-by-handle interfaces like I implied it was.

Depends how you look at it. You can't extend the kernel's idea of
time without permanent storage being able to specify the supported
bounds - that's a non-negotiable aspect of introducing extended
epoch timestamp support.

The actual addition of extended timestamp support to each individual
filesystem is orthoganol to the introduction of the struct
inode_time, but doing this addition properly is dependent on the VFS
infrastructure being there in the first place.

Right, but the issue is that 64 bit second counters are broken right
now because most filesystems can't support more than 32 bit values.
So it doesn't matter whether it's 32 bit or 64 bit machines, just
adding explicit support for >32 bit second counters without doing
anything else just extends that brokenness into the indefinite
future.

If we don't fix it now (i.e in the new user API and supporting
infrastructure), then we'll *never be able to fix it* and we'll be
stuck with timestamps that do really weird things when you pass
arbitrary future dates to the kernel.

It's a pretty common way of extending the range of a variable for
on-disk formats. The on-disk format is completely disconnected from
the in-memory representation, so it's "easy" to play games like this
within the on-disk format.

If you look closely at ext4, you'll see all the lo/hi variables
where extension of 16->32 bits or 32->48 bits has occurred from
the ext2/3 variable formats... ;)

Because I wasn't trying to solve the entire problem, just
demonstrate the infrastructure needed to support extended
timestamps.....

Also, I don't like the concept of having filesystems that will work
on 64 bit but not 32 bit machines. Over the past 10 years, we've
managed to remove most of those differences from the VFS and XFS,
so adding new distinctions between 32/64 bit machines is not the
direction I want to head in.

As it is, I'm expecting to do this only after the struct inode_time
and the superblock "time range" infrastructure have been added to
the kernel and VFS.  If that change is not made, then we've still
only got 32 bit time....

Yes, we could set the flag on the first timestamp that goes beyond
the current epoch, but that has two problems:

	1. filesystem silently becomes incompatible with older
	kernels so failed upgrade rollbacks become problematic; and

	2. It adds unecessary complexity, as this will end up being
	the default behaviour for all new filesystems within a year.
	Then we end up with a mount option and conversion functions
	that never get used but we have to support for years....

We've got plenty of time to roll this out so I don't see any need
for putting in place temporary support mechanisms that unnecessarily
complicate the code.

Cheers,

Dave.
