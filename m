Right. I don't know of anyone using the cgroup_freeze stuff. OTOH, I've
seen *many* reports of people who complained because their machine
didn't suspend because of a busy NFS mount.

In fact, the problem is still not fully "solved" with the
freezable_schedule stuff we have so far anyway. Even after this
(admittedly crappy) solution went in, we still had reports of machines
that failed to suspend because other tasks were stuck in
wait_on_page_writeback() for NFS pages.

So, in principle I think we need to abandon the current approach. The
question is what should replace it.
