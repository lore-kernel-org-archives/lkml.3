permitted is initialized to 0

First the original ptrace_may_access() check did not hold
cred_guard_mutex, so add it. If we can't grab mutex then let permitted
to be zero. Yes this a change in behaviour and I think it's correct, IOW
we were not able to perform the ptrace_may_access() check, otherwise
permitted will depend on checks result.

However, there is still a race here since we set the permitted value
before gathering the appropriate info about task. At the read() data moment
this target task may have been gone privileged... , acquiring an X lock
on target task, will just break/slow things, as it has been shown before...
Not to mention that the race window is small...

I don't understand what you mean by "do the entire check" ?

the /proc/pid/stat file is used by "ps", "top" ... it's a vital file
We don't want to break it, otherwise "ps" will hide processes. So just
do the ptrace_may_access() check correctly with the help of
proc_allow_access() and set the permitted variable only. The patch did
not touch /proc/pid/stat fields.

I've done tests on ps and top, and they work fine.
