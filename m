Yeah, the difficult part is getting the right balance between:

1) limitations due to seccomp's impossibility to chase pointers (which 
is not something that can be lifted, as it's required for correctness)

2) subtlety and complexity of the resulting code.

The problem stems when you have a single a single syscall operating on 
multiple file descriptors.  So for example among the cases you mention 
poll and select are problematic; sendm?msg are not.  They would be if 
Capsicum had a capability for SCM_RIGHTS file descriptor passing, but I 
cannot find it.

But then you also have to strike the right balance between a complete 
solution and an overengineered one.

For example, even though poll and select are problematic, I wonder what 
would really the point be in blocking them; poll/select are 
level-triggered, and calling them should be idempotent as far as the 
file descriptor is concerned.  If you want to prevent a process/thread 
from issuing blocking system calls, but you'd do that with a per-process 
filter, not with per-file-descriptor filters or capabilities.

Good to know, thanks.  I suppose you have testcases that cover this.
