Probably I've missed good comments, but I've tried to make things correct
Here are an flush implementation assumptions from block/blk-flush.c:

Currently, the following conditions are used to determine when to e flush.

C1. At any given time, only one flush shall be in progress.  This is
    double buffering sufficient.
C2. Flush is deferred if any request is executing DATA of its ence.
    This avoids issuing separate POSTFLUSHes for requests which ed
    PREFLUSH.
C3. The second condition is ignored if there is a request which has
    waited longer than FLUSH_PENDING_TIMEOUT.  This is to avoid
    starvation in the unlikely case where there are continuous am of
    FUA (without FLUSH) requests.

So if we will increment flush_tag counter in two places:
blk_kick_flush: the place where flush request is issued
flush_end_io : the place where flush is completed
And by using rule (C1) we can guarantee that

if (flush_tag & 0x1 == 1) then flush_tag  is in progress
if (flush_tag & 0x1 == 0) then (flush_tag & ~(0x1)) completed
In other words we can define it as:

FLUSH_TAG_IDX    = (flush_tag +1) & ~0x1
FLUSH_TAG_STATE  = flush_tag & 0x1 ? IN_PROGRESS : COMPLETED

After that we can define rules for flush optimization:
We can be sure that our data was flushed only if:
1) data's bio was completed before flush request was QUEUED
   and COMPLETED
So in terms of formulas we can write it like follows:
is_data_flushed = (blkdev->flush_tag & ~(0x1)) >
                  ((data->flush_tag + 0x1) & (~0x1))
