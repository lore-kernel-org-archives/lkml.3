Yes, we use ioctl() so we are safe here! if there is a a suid process
that does perform arbitrary ioctl() on intrusted passed fds,
then we are already in truble given all the already available ioctl()
(not only kdbus, all available ioctl()... we blame the client), so yes
usual write()/read() do not work here.

But we do perform the creds check against the cred of connection
creation time, if you open the fd you do not have the connection,
you still need a KDBUS_CMD_HELLO ioctl() on the fd, and during that time
we store the creds, and we perform all the TALK, SEE and OWN against
those creds (uid/gid). It is like a second connect() call, unless you
perform the KDBUS_CMD_HELLO you are not connected, and after turning
your fd to a connection, a service can restrict its access (TALK, OWN
and SEE) policies, not all connected peers can TALK (send messages) to
a service.
