Subject: [GIT PULL] NFS/FS-Cache: Fix crash from accidentally starting caching whilst writing

Hi Trond,

Can you pull these commits to fix an issue with NFS whereby caching can be
enabled on a file that is open for writing by subsequently opening it for
reading.  This can be made to crash by opening it for writing again if you're
quick enough.

The gist of the patchset is that the cookie should be acquired at inode
creation only and subsequently enabled and disabled as appropriate (which
dispenses with the backing objects when they're not needed).

The extra synchronisation that NFS does can then be dispensed with as it is
thenceforth managed by FS-Cache.

Could you send these on to Linus?

This likely will need fixing also in CIFS and 9P also once the FS-Cache
changes are upstream.  AFS and Ceph are probably safe.

Thanks,
David
