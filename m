Interesting, thanks.

I'll think a bit on how to best address these.

Would running them each in user namespaces with different mappings (all
jobs running as uid 1000, but uid 1000  mapped to different host uids
for each job) would be (long-term) feasible?

I was assuming that any process requesting management of
/c1/c2/c3 would have to be in one of its ancestor cgroups (i.e. /c1)

So if you have two jobs running as uid 1000, one under /c1 and one
under /c2, and one as uid 1001 running under /c3 (with the uids owning
the cgroups), then the file permissions will prevent 1000 and 1001
from walk over each other, while the cgroup manager will not allow
a process (child manager or otherwise) under /c1 to manage cgroups
under /c2 and vice versa.

No, but it might not be worth it (other than the readme) :) - so far
it's only served to help me think through what I want and need from
the mgr.

I'm definately open to your requirements - whether providing what
you need for another layer on top, or building it right in.
