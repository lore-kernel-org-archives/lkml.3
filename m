If nothing else, the fact that rdpmc fails with SIGSEGV instead of
with some nonsense value means that this will always be racy.

I tried it.  Rough numbers on my 2.7 GHz Sandy Bridge laptop

Writing to cr4 in VMX non-root (changing PCE) takes ~48ns.  RMW cr4
takes rougly 51ns.  IMO neither of these is enough to be worth
worrying *that* much about when switching into or out of a perf-using
task.  But you might disagree with me.

Changing TSD takes 700ns, because KVM has the VMCS programmed wrong.
I'll send a patch.

I suspect that the same experiment on bare metal would run faster.
