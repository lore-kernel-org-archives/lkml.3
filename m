This was basically my opinion before I started running test also with SSDs. As you can see from, e.g., Figure 8 in
http://algogroup.unimore.it/people/paolo/disk_sched/extra_results.php
or Figure 9 in
http://algogroup.unimore.it/people/paolo/disk_sched/results.php
with deadline, as with NOOP and even worse with CFQ, start-up times become unbearably high while some files are being read sequentially. I have got even higher latencies on Intel SSDs.

One of the main reasons is that these schedulers allow the drive to queue more than one request. Maybe adding some of the low-latency heuristics of bfq to deadline may help, but it should be investigated.
