Yes, please submit an updated patch for the kernel.  Ted will hopefully
merge it this time.

I don't know that we really care about dtime so much, since it is mostly
just treated as "zero =3D=3D not deleted" and "non-zero =3D=3D deleted" =
by e2fsck,
and maybe useful for manual debugging.  We might consider that it uses a
sliding window in the future, since I'm sure we won't care about files
deleted more than 70 years ago, and if we did the fact that they appear
to be files deleted 70 years in the future won't matter so much.  In any
case, that can be looked at in a separate patch.

Cheers, Andreas
