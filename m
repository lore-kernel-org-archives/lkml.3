I think we also need to sync this in Documentation:

Documentation: virtual: kvm: remove ia64

kvm/ia64 would be gone so just clean Documentation.

-Currently, kvm module is in EXPERIMENTAL stage on IA64. This means that
-interfaces are not stable enough to use. So, please don't run critical
-applications in virtual machine.
-We will try our best to improve it in future versions!
-
-                               Guide: How to boot up guests on kvm/ia64
-
-This guide is to describe how to enable kvm support for IA-64 systems.
-
-1. Get the kvm source from git.kernel.org.
-       Userspace source:
-               git clone 
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/virt/kvm/kvm-userspace.git
-       Kernel Source:
-               git clone 
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/xiantao/kvm-ia64.git
-
-2. Compile the source code.
-       2.1 Compile userspace code:
-               (1)cd ./kvm-userspace
-               (2)./configure
-               (3)cd kernel
-               (4)make sync LINUX= $kernel_dir (kernel_dir is the 
directory of kernel source.)
-               (5)cd ..
-               (6)make qemu
-               (7)cd qemu; make install
-
-       2.2 Compile kernel source code:
-               (1) cd ./$kernel_dir
-               (2) Make menuconfig
-               (3) Enter into virtualization option, and choose kvm.
-               (4) make
-               (5) Once (4) done, make modules_install
-               (6) Make initrd, and use new kernel to reboot up host 
machine.
-               (7) Once (6) done, cd $kernel_dir/arch/ia64/kvm
-               (8) insmod kvm.ko; insmod kvm-intel.ko
-
-Note: For step 2, please make sure that host page size == 
TARGET_PAGE_SIZE of qemu, otherwise, may fail.
-
-3. Get Guest Firmware named as Flash.fd, and put it under right place:
-       (1) If you have the guest firmware (binary) released by Intel 
Corp for Xen, use it directly.
-
-       (2) If you have no firmware at hand, Please download its source from
-               hg clone http://xenbits.xensource.com/ext/efi-vfirmware.hg
-           you can get the firmware's binary in the directory of 
efi-vfirmware.hg/binaries.
-
-       (3) Rename the firmware you owned to Flash.fd, and copy it to 
/usr/local/share/qemu
-
-4. Boot up Linux or Windows guests:
-       4.1 Create or install a image for guest boot. If you have xen 
experience, it should be easy.
-
-       4.2 Boot up guests use the following command.
-               /usr/local/bin/qemu-system-ia64 -smp xx -m 512 -hda 
$your_image
-               (xx is the number of virtual processors for the guest, 
now the maximum value is 4)
-
-5. Known possible issue on some platforms with old Firmware.
-
-In the event of strange host crash issues, try to solve it through 
either of the following ways:
-
-(1): Upgrade your Firmware to the latest one.
-
-(2): Applying the below patch to kernel source.
