Ok,I agree with you that we should make container security by default.

What's your idea that introduces option MS_NOT_A_LOCK just like Andy's
advisement?

In libvirt, host creates dev and devpts directories for container,then
mount devpts, tmpfs on them and create device nodes inside these dirs
for container. and then in container, these filesystems are moved to
container's /dev/ /dev/pts directory. We really have no need to lock
these mounts. they are just created for container.

Thanks
