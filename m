Actually:

	- two callers (fuse and nfs) take advantage of the NULL case.

	- d_splice_alias handles inode == NULL in the same way, and
	  almost every caller takes advantage of that.

So at least we wouldn't want to actually make the caller handle this
case.

But maybe there's still some opportunity for cleanup or documentation.
