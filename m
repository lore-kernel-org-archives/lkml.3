So, now, you know you can handle "threshould".

If you want to implement "automatic-oom-killall-in-a-contanier-threshold-in-kernel",
I don't have any objections.

What you want is not limit, you want a trigger for killing process.
Threshold + Kill is enough, using res_counter for that is overspec.

You don't need res_counter and don't need to break other guy's use case.
