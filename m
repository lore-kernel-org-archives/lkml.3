Ok, I see. Thanks for taking a look so quickly.

Well, it happened on 3.8-rc4 and on 3.5 here, so I'd guess it's a
different one.

The machine has had problems with data consistency in the past, so
I'm not too surprised with getting a single-bit error, although this
is the first time in a year that I've seen problems, and I replaced
the faulty memory modules some time ago.

Anyway, I already ordered a replacement box a few weeks ago, and that
one will have ECC memory besides being a modern Opteron system to replace
the aging Core 2.

Ok. I'll wait before reformmatting though, in case you need to take
a look at the data later to find out why it crashed without fsck finding
a problem.
