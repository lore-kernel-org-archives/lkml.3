Also, is this really the only place that needs this?

I guess NFS for now allows mounts only in the initial namespace, so the
idmap upcalls can always be done there.  Module lookup and any usermode
helpers used for hardware setup probably also only happen in the initial
namespace.  Hrm.  Still, seems likely to be useful to someone
eventually.
