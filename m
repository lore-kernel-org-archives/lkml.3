Sounds intriguing...

I'm not sure what this really means for something like NFS though. How
would you envision this working when we have long running syscalls that
might sit waiting in the kernel indefinitely?

Here's my blue-sky, poorly-thought-out idea...

We could add a signal (e.g. SIGFREEZE) that allows the sleeps in
NFS/RPC layer to be interrupted. Those would return back toward
userland with a particular type of error (sort of like ERESTARTSYS).

Before returning from the kernel though, we could freeze the process.
When it wakes up, then we could go back down and retry the call again
(much like an ERESTARTSYS kind of thing).

The tricky part here is that we'd need to distinguish between the case
where we caught SIGFREEZE before sending an RPC vs. after. If we sent
the call before freezing, then we don't want to resend it again. It
might be a non-idempotent operation.

Sounds horrific to code up though... :)
