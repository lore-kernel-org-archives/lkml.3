cmd and comm are trivially replaceable by any sender.

To me, this smells like bad design.  By using kdbus, I implicitly
agree to send everyone my command line?!?  If I'm in a cgroup that
policy decrees should be privileged, then I should invoke that
privilege by specifically asking, *at the time of capture*, to send
that cgroup.  Otherwise it becomes unclear what things convey
privilege when, and that will lead immediately to incomprehensible
security models, and that will lead to exploits.

<snark>Sorry, but "implicitly agree" sounds a lot like using my
esteemed cellphone carrier.  When I use it, some argue that I
implicitly agree to have my identity prepended to all outgoing HTTP
requests.  This is *not* a good thing.</snark>

Not if you have a sensible LSM policy or if you use hidepid.  And,
once you've fixed the namespacing issues, not if the sender and
receiver are in different PID namespaces or if they don't have /proc
mounted at all.

This is a bug.  It prevents users from usefully sandboxing themselves
in a kdbus world.  If you create and enter a user namespace, then your
outside identity (which should be unchanged) is suppressed.  (Note
that anything that captures credentials other than at open time is
also an issue for sandboxes in the other direction: it may interfere
with selective privilege dropping.)

SCM_CREDENTIALS translates the translatable parts.

There should be a number measured in, say, nanoseconds in here
somewhere.  The actual extent of the speedup is unmeasurable here.
Also, it's worth reading at least one of Linus' many rants about
zero-copy.  It's not an automatic win.
