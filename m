Looks like this sort of thing has been seen before, in other drives (one 
of which is from the same family as my drive):

http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-scsi/msg65292.html

http://iamlinux.technoyard.in/blog/why-is-my-ssd-disk-not-reconized-by-the-rhel6-anaconda-installer/

Perhaps the ST900MM0026 should be blacklisted as well?

Or maybe the SCSI code should do a variation on Mike Snitzer's original 
patch and just ignore any values above some reasonable threshold?  (And 
then we could remove the blacklist on the ST900MM0006.)
