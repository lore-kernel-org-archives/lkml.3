Gah.  Does this fix it?

A struct xdr_stream at a page boundary might point to the end of one
page or the beginning of the next, and I'm guessing xdr_truncate_encode
wasn't prepared to handle the former.

This happens if the readdir entry that would have exceeded the client's
dircount/maxcount limit would have ended exactly on a 4k page boundary,
and inspection of the trace shows you're hitting exactly that case.

If this does the job then I'll go figure out how to make this logic less
ugly....
