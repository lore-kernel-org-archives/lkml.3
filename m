I'll pull some concrete examples together.  I don't have them on hand,
and I am out of country this week.  I have looped in the gang at work
(though some are here with me).

We've had great success letting users create sub-cgroups in a few
specific controller types (cpu, cpuacct, memory).  This is, of course,
with some restrictions.  We do not just give them blanket access to
all knobs.  We don't need ALL cgroups, just the important ones.

For a simple example, letting users create sub-groups in freezer or
job (we have a job group that we've been carrying) lets them launch
sub-tasks and manage them in a very clean way.

We've been doing a LOT of development internally to make user-defined
sub-memcgs work in our cluster scheduling system, and it's made some
of our biggest, more insane users very happy.

And for some cgroups, like cpuset, hierarchy just doesn't really make
sense to me.  I just don't care if that never works, though I have no
problem with others wanting it. :)   Aside: if the last CPU in your
cpuset goes offline, you should go into a state akin to freezer.
Running on any other CPU is an overt violation of policy that the
user, or worse - the admin, set up.  Just my 2cents.

Look for this in the next few days/weeks.  From our point of view,
cgroups are the ideal match for how we want to manage things (no
surprise, really, since Mr. Menage worked on both).
