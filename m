Yeah, I think I agree here too. Best to keep the interface as simple
as possible, and the principle of least surprise would dictate that the
return value match how other flock() calls work.

I would still like to see a proposed manpage update for it. For bonus
points, writing a section on flock() for the glibc manual might help
get that piece merged as well.

It was my experience that getting the small header file #defines into
glibc for OFD locks was much more difficult than the kernel piece. YMMV
of course, but getting the glibc folks to buy into the idea ahead of
time would be good if possible.
