I've been carrying this patch locally for over a year. Is there any
chance of someone trying to remove this buildtime warning?

I'm inclined to submit a path to Fedora - my local builds use
their .config as a base - to just disable this driver. It seems that
would increase my chances of finally shutting down this warning.
