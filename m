We're talking 2001 here ;) Try leaping into your retro time machine and
run dbench on ext2 on a spinny disk and I expect you'll see significant
performance changes.

The problem back in 2001 was that we held lock_page() across the
duration of page writeback, so if another thread came in and tried to
dirty the page, it would block on lock_page() until IO completion.  I
can't remember whether writeback would also block read().  Maybe it did,
in which case the effects of this patchset won't be as dramatic as were
the effects of splitting PG_lock into PG_lock and PG_writeback.

OK, thanks, that sounds reasonable.

Do we generate nice kernel messages (at mount or device-probe time)
which will permit people to work out which strategy their device/fs is
using?
