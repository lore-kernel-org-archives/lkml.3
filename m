Subject: [PATCH RFC 0/2] percpu_tags: Prototype implementation

Hello Gentleman,

This is a development of "percpu_ida" library. I named it
"percpu_tags" to simplify review, since most of "percpu_ida"
code has gone and a diff would not be informative.

While the concept of per-cpu arrays is is preserved, the
implementation is heavily reworked. The main objective is to
improve the "percpu_ida" locking scheme.

Here is the list of major differrences between "percpu_ida" and
"percpu_tags":

* The global freelist has gone. As result, CPUs do not compete
  for the global lock.

* Long-running operatons (scanning thru a cpumask) are executed
  with local interrupts enabled;

* percpu_ida::percpu_max_size limit is eliminated. Instead, the
  limit is determined dynamically. Depending from how many CPUs
  are requesting tags each CPU gets a fair share of the tag space;

* A tag is attempted to return to the CPU it was allocated on. As
  result, it is expected the locality of data associated with the
  tag benefits;

The code is largely raw and untested. The reason I am posting
is the prototype implementation performs 2-3 times faster than
"percpu_ida", so I would like to ensure if it worth going further
with this approach or is there a no-go.

The performance test is not decent, though. I used "fio" random
read against a "null_blk" device sitting on top of "percpu_tags",
which is not exactly how "percpu_ida" is used. This is another
reason I am posting - an advice on how to properly test is very
appreciated.

Thanks!
