Subject: [PATCHv4 0/5] ceph: persistent caching with fscache

This an updated version of the fscache support for the Ceph filesystem. What's
changed since the last patchset:

1. Sparater the readpages refactor into it's own patches. These were already
   accepted into the testing branch.

2. Tracked down the BUG in readahead cleanup code. We were returning with pages
   marked as private_2 from readpages(). I added a simple convenience function
   to the fscache netfs interface for cleaning up the page list at the end of
   asop readpages(). I know other filesystems (NFS) have ran into that since
   I've seen a few similar traces in Google search and the cachefs mailig list.
   The second patch new make Ceph use this interface.

I've been running this code (minus the BUG fix) on clients for a couple weeks
with moderate 24/7 use without issues. At this point in time I feel like it's
solid enough to go into the ceph kclient.

Please pull the code from my repository:
https://bitbucket.org/adfin/linux-fs.git branch: wip-ceph-fscache

The first two patches I included were not written by me but were written by 
Hongyi Jia. He implemented the cookie re-validation scheme into fscache core.

Finally, I CCed a couple other mailing lists (fsdevel, nfs) because the new
fscache_readpages_cancel() should be used by other filesystems to avoid the
same problem.
