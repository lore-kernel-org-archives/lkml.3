Yes, you're right.  That would be for a host bridge that converts I/O
on the primary (upstream) side of the bridge to memory on the PCI
side.  I've never seen such a bridge, and I can't really imagine why
anybody would do that.  But I guess you should be able to safely
ignore _TRA when _TTP is set in either a MEM or IO descriptor, because
the same reasoning should apply to both.

If _TTP is not set, I guess you would apply _TRA.  That's what you
already do for MEM descriptors, and think you should just do the same
for IO descriptors.  I would guess that having _TTP = 0 and _TRA != 0
is rare for IO descriptors, but I suppose it could happen.
