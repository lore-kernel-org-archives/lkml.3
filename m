no worries on that, it's important this is done right and I appreciate
your reviews.

what could make it simpler is simply drop the notion of local settings:
if it's changed locally, just check if it's allowed and do it.
propagation simply will mirror the parent cgroup. But other than that, I
don't see any easier way.

so, doing the two steps slowly:
1) parent changes to ALLOW: B gets to keep deny because it's a local
   setting and it's allowed. revalidate_local_exceptions() will probably
   keep all the local exceptions since parent's change to ALLOW will
   reset its exception list; so any exception to DENY in B will be
   allowed.
1.1) parent gets new exceptions (or not): some of the local exceptions
     in B might be dropped since they'll not be allowed anymore
2) parent changes to DENY: B keeps DENY but ends up indirectly losing
   all its local exceptions anyway because parent's behavior change will
   also clear all exceptions and will deny everything.

the whole idea is to never a child should have access to more devices than
its parent.

that is correct. the idea of setting local.behavior is to make sure
local.exceptions are interpreted correctly: are they exceptions to
DENY or ALLOW?

that makes sense. not sure how to do that though. will think in
something.
