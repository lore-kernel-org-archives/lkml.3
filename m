Hi Linus,

Now with DKIM + SPF in place on linux-iscsi.org (thanks for the help Ted
& Co), here is another attempt at the target fixes PULL request for
v3.11 that was missed.

Given that the last PULL emails hit your spam folder, if/when you get
this please give me a quick response to confirm.

Please go ahead and pull from:

  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/nab/target-pending.git master

The first patch is to address a long standing issue where INQUIRY vendor
+ model response data was not correctly padded with ASCII spaces,
causing MSFT and Falconstor multipath stacks to not function with our
LUNs.

The second -> forth patches are additional iscsi-target regression fixes
for the post >= v3.10 iser-target changes.  The second and third are
failure cases that have appeared during further testing, and the forth
is only reproducible with malformed NOP packets.

The fifth patch is a v3.11 specific regression caused by a recent
optimization that showed up during WRITE I/O failure testing.

I'll be sending Patch #1 and Patch #5 to Greg-KH separately for stable.

Thank you,

--nab
