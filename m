OK, let me try.  I did draw straws with Jens at LSF to see who would
look at this and he lost, but the complexity of the patch set probably
makes it hard for him to find the time.

The first problem, which Tejun already pointed out is that you've
combined a "bug fix" with a large feature set in such a way that they
can't be separated, so saying the first four patches fix a bug isn't
helpful.

The second problem is that it's not at all clear what the bug actually
is.  You have to wade through tons of red hat bugzillas before you come
up with the fact that there's one command which we allow users to send
which is ambiguous: GPCMD_READ_SUBCHANNEL which has the same opcode as
UNMAP on a disk.  Once you finally work this out, you wonder what all
the fuss is about because UNMAP is advisory ... even if an unprivileged
user can now send the command, it can't be used to damage any data or
even get access to any data, so there doesn't seem to be an actual bug
to fix at all.

The various committees do try hard to ensure there's no opcode
overlap ... although they don't always succeed as you see with the UNMAP
above, so I'm not at all sure we need the huge complexity of per scsi
device type command filter lists, which is what the rest of the feature
additions is about.

The third problem is that in order to verify that all the code motion
doesn't actually introduce a bug, you have to wade through about seven
patches ... the patch split really isn't at all conducive to reviewing
this critical piece.

Finally, the patch for the feature I think you actually want, which is
13/14, could have been implemented fairly simply as a single patch and
doesn't have to be part of this series.
