If you insist.  ;-)  Done.

Nope, just got the "ACQUIRE" and "RELEASE" backwards.  The sentence
below now reads:

	In short, a ACQUIRE followed by an RELEASE may -not- be assumed
	to be a full memory barrier.

> > In short, a RELEASE
> >+followed by an ACQUIRE may -not- be assumed to be a full memory barrier.

But I do need an transition sentence before the following paragraph.

I added this to the beginning of the following paragraph:

	Similarly, the reverse case of a RELEASE followed by an ACQUIRE
	does not imply a full memory barrier.

Agreed, avoiding random use of synonyms makes it clearer.  These are
now changed as you suggest.

I guess I didn't explicitly call out this before, so agree on deleting
"again".  Done.
