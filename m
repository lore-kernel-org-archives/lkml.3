Not exactly.  PSCSI has no mode where control commands are handled by
the in-kernel emulation.

For OSD strictly speaking in the T10 sense, the use-case your describing
would fall under the guise of I/O mode, where the OSD specific CDBs
would be propagated into the user-space backend driver.  This would
probably be OK, and the only thing that would need to change from the
perspective of existing in-kernel emulation is to expose TYPE_OSD
instead of TYPE_DISK.  Eg: AFAICT, there aren't any OSD specific EVPD or
mode pages.

As for optical discs, things are more complex because of mode pages
specific to MMC that effectively make it difficult to mark a clear
delineation between a hybrid I/O mode approach where some CDBs are
handed by in-kernel emulation, and some are handled in user-space.

So that said, an I/O mode that passes through OSD specific CDBs into
user-space should allow ALUA to still work as expected for TYPE_OSD,
where with optical drives it's less clear how to make a clean split, or
if anyone actually cares enough about ALUA emulation with TYPE_ROM.
