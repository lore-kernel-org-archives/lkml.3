The RPC layer already keeps RPC round trip statistics, so the client doesn't have to guess with a "one size fits all" number.

I'm all for keeping client recovery time short.  But after following this argument, I think 10xRTT is crazy short.  Aggressive retransmits can lead to data corruption, and RTT on a fast server is going to be on the order of a millisecond.  And what about RDMA, where RTT is about 20usecs? 

A better answer might be to start at one second then exponentially back off to the minimum of 0.25x the lease time and 0.25x the RPC retransmit time out.
