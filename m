Ah yes, I didn't even notice that nasty side effect. I just deleted that
"really, really" NUL-termination line because it was based on a
misunderstanding of snprintf()'s postcondition. Even if
len=3D=3Dsizeof(fname) this still would have given the wrong example for
others to follow.

Ah yes, forgot that. Would it be sufficient if I sent a reply to all
those patch mails with next line tacked on, or would it require a
resubmission?
