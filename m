Oops. Sorry, the correct sub-sub-sub-sub-....paragraph is this one:

         Permission to execute a file.

         Servers SHOULD allow a user the ability to read the data of the
         file when only the ACE4_EXECUTE access mask bit is allowed.
         This is because there is no way to execute a file without
         reading the contents.  Though a server may treat ACE4_EXECUTE
         and ACE4_READ_DATA bits identically when deciding to permit a
         READ operation, it SHOULD still allow the two bits to be set
         independently in ACLs, and MUST distinguish between them when
         replying to ACCESS operations.  In particular, servers SHOULD
         NOT silently turn on one of the two bits when the other is set,
         as that would make it impossible for the client to correctly
         enforce the distinction between read and execute permissions.

Same conclusion, though....
