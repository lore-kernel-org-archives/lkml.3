Hello, Daniel.

I think we should add a comment to the doc saying "this is how to keep
things from falling apart completely but in no way is a long term
solution."

I suppose that can be useful for now but pretty strongly disagree it
would be acceptable as long term solution.

Sure, then make it request the persistency explicitly.  The debate is
not whether trusting each individual player can show similar result.
Sure, that's in the realm of possibility.  If you push it as far as
"everyone" should and would behave properly even on edge cases, I
would have to add "theoretical" there tho.  The debate is which is the
better way to achieve the desired goals and up until now I don't see
any pros for the distributed approach other than "this is what we've
been doing till now".

Again, I don't know.  It can be useful for now I suppose.  I just
can't see it being the long term solution.

Yeah, by asking cooperations from individual players without any way
to monitor or police them.

I'm not sure about this one.  Yeah, we might need delegation there at
least for now.  That said, it's not gonna be completely consistent.
Root cgroup is special for several controllers and we even have
controllers which propagate config changes down the hierarchy.  It
just isn't built for proper delegation.

It's unlikely to work that well.  I think a good mental image to have
for cgroup is that of sysctl rather than a generic file system.  You
can't go delegate sysctl control knobs to containers or !root users.
You need an extra layer of control to do that.  It's true that such
policing could happen in the kernel, but something in the kernel being
exposed to untrusted entities has a lot of implications as the kernel
now becomes heavily involved in *policy* decisions as to what can be
allowed and what can't be and the kernel has a lot less latitude in
making those decisions compared to userland base system.

There are also security implications.  memcg control knobs directly
regulate the operation of memory reclaim and writeback.  I wouldn't be
surprised if there are pretty easy ways to make them go bonkers while
staying inside the limits from the parent.  Again, think of sysctl.
You don't wanna hand these out to untrusted entities.

Well, you guys can try I guess.  Maybe I'm wrong and workman turns out
to be awesome.  I'll be happy to switch my position then, but for now,
the kernel isn't moving towards that direction.

Thanks.
