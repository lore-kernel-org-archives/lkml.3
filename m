Hi Alexander,

So given the feedback from Tejun, I'm going to setup back for the moment
from a larger conversion, and keep the SHT->cmd_size=0 setting for
libata in the scsi-mq WIP branch.

I'm happy to accept patches to drop the bitmap piece that Tejun
mentioned if your interested, but at least on my end right now there are
bigger fish to fry for scsi-mq.  ;)

Thanks,
