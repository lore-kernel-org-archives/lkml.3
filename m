Yes,  this is their temporary holding area.  Once the chunks are
transmitted again, they are placed on the transports transmitted list.
See sctp_outq_flush_rtx().

Retransmit queue may hold more data then can be drained in a single
push.  Thus is usually holds data that is pending retransmission, but
is not retransmitted yet.  If a late SACK arrives acknowledging this
data, we need to properly mark it.  That is what this code tries
to do.
