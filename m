Sorry, this patch is created on oracle uek kernel, I just checked it can
apply to vanilla kernel cleanly and didn't notice they are using
different device attribute function name.

No, I just want to keep the modification as small as possible. Checked
the actions of sd_revalidate_disk() again, it seems no harm to call it
from here. Also actual actions are skipped in sd_read_cache_type() if
cache_override!=0, so I suppose your original plan is to jump to
sd_revalidate_disk() from here.

However, that way may not be acceptable after further code review.
Changing the sdkp->WCE,RCD will cause these real parameters of the
underlying device *lost*. In sd_shutdown() and sd_suspend_common(), we
need them to call sd_sync_cache() if necessary. I don't think this
action is avoidable, just for the performance issue to solve. And we
can't change the mode just by setting q->flush_flags while leave
sdkp->WCE,RCD untouched either, because cache_type_show() needs
sdkp->WCE,RCD to present the temporary config to userspace.

static void sd_shutdown(struct device *dev)
{
...
	if (sdkp->WCE && sdkp->media_present) {
		sd_printk(KERN_NOTICE, sdkp, "Synchronizing SCSI cache\n");
		sd_sync_cache(sdkp);
	}

static int sd_suspend_common(struct device *dev, bool ignore_stop_errors)
{
...
	if (sdkp->WCE && sdkp->media_present) {
		sd_printk(KERN_NOTICE, sdkp, "Synchronizing SCSI cache\n");
		ret = sd_sync_cache(sdkp);

So, It seems new fields like realWCE and readRCD in scsi_disk are needed
to save those configuration. What's your opinion?
