I think reflecting the reality of the system is the correct way to go.
Attempting to do the derandomization on the live system seems
extremely fragile. It's much cleaner to have a "true" view of the
running system and work from there. I don't want to have to wonder if
my kernel is lying to me about where things are in memory any more
than it already does. :)
