It's a separate mail that does not carry any diff but an overview of
the following patches. The patches are threaded under that mail. This is
what the git command does for you:

  git format-patch -o output --thread --cover-letter from..to

and in the directory 'output' you'll find the cover letter plus patches.
The cover contains some stub and should be edited.  Then send them via
'git send-email'.

The integration is in Chris' git, but the branch may not be the most
recent compared to Linus' tree or the pending for-linus branches. This
depens on the phase of the development cycle or the stability of the
patches in the integration branch as it's supposed to be base of the
next pull.

What you did is fine under current conditions. If the integration is
made public you can check if your patches are merged or not and then
refresh the patch series eventually.

Up to you.
