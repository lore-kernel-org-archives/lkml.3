Hi Jeff,
 I haven't looked very closely at the code, but in principal I think this is
 an excellent idea.  Having to set a number of threads manually was never
 nice as it is impossible to give sensible guidance on what an appropriate
 number is.
 Tying max_active to "threads" doesn't really make sense I think.
 "max_active" is a per-cpu number and I think the only meaningful numbers a=
re
 "1" (meaning concurrent works might mutually deadlock) or infinity (which =
is
 approximated as 512).  I would just ignore the "threads" number when
 workqueues are used.... or maybe enable workqueues when "auto" is written =
to
 "threads"??

 Using a shrinker to manage the allocation and freeing of svc_rqst is a
 really good idea.  It will put pressure on the effective number of threads
 when needed, but will not artificially constrain things.

 The combination of workqueue and shrinker seems like a perfect match for
 nfsd.

 I hope you can work out the latency issues!

Thanks,
NeilBrown
