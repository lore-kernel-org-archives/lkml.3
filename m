Dear Viresh Kumar,

I tried your set of patches for isolating particular CPU cores from unpinned
timers. On x86_64 they were working fine, however I found out that on ARM
they would fail under the following test:

# mount -t cpuset none /cpuset
# cd /cpuset
# mkdir rt
# cd rt
# echo 1 > cpus
# echo 1 > cpu_exclusive
# cd
# taskset 0x2 ./setquiesce.sh  <--- contains "echo 1 > /cpuset/rt/quiesce"

I also backported your patches to Linux 3.10.y and found the same problem
both in ARM and x86_64. However, I think I figured out the reason for those
errors. Please, could you check the patch below (it applies on the top of
your tree, branch isolate-cpusets) and let me know what you think?

Thanks,
Daniel

-------------------------PATCH STARTS HERE---------------------------------
cpuset: quiesce: change irq disable/enable by irq save/restore

The function __migrate_timers can be called under interrupt context
or thread context depending on the core where the system call was
executed. In case it executes under interrupt context, it
seems a bad idea to leave interrupts enabled after migrating the
timers. In fact, this caused kernel errors on the ARM architecture and
on the x86_64 architecture with the 3.10 kernel (backported version
of the cpuset-quiesce patch).
