Subject: [PATCH 5/7] cgroup: update how a newly forked task gets associated with css_set
Date: Thu, 13 Feb 2014 15:28:51 -0500

When a new process is forked, cgroup_fork() associates it with the
css_set of its parent but doesn't link it into it.  After the new
process is linked to tasklist, cgroup_post_fork() does the linking.

This is problematic for cgroup_transfer_tasks() as there's no way to
tell whether there are tasks which are pointing to a css_set but not
linked yet.  It is impossible to implement an operation which transfer
all tasks of a cgroup to another and the current
cgroup_transfer_tasks() can easily be tricked into leaving a newly
forked process behind if it gets called between cgroup_fork() and
cgroup_post_fork().

Let's make association with a css_set and linking atomic by moving it
to cgroup_post_fork().  cgroup_fork() sets child->cgroups to
init_css_set as a placeholder and cgroup_post_fork() is updated to
perform both the association with the parent's cgroup and linking
there.  This means that a newly created task will point to
init_css_set without holding a ref to it much like what it does on the
exit path.  Empty cg_list is used to indicate that the task isn't
holding a ref to the associated css_set.

This fixes an actual bug with cgroup_transfer_tasks(); however, I'm
not marking it for -stable.  The whole thing is broken in multiple
other ways which require invasive updates to fix and I don't think
it's worthwhile to bother with backporting this particular one.
Fortunately, the only user is cpuset and these bugs don't crash the
machine.
