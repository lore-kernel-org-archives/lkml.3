  You can remove the pluggin here. Inode update will likely result in a
single write so there's no point.

  Hum, is there a reason for update_cmtime_deferred() operation? I can
hardly imagine anyone will want to do anything else than what
inode_update_time_writable() does so why bother? You mention tmpfs & co.
don't fit into your scheme well with which I agree so let's just keep
file_update_time() in their page_mkwrite() operation. But I don't see a
real need for avoiding the deferred cmtime logic...

  This is wrong because SB_FREEZE_FS level is targetted for filesystem
internal use. Also it is racy. mapping_flush_cmtime() ends up calling
mark_inode_dirty() and filesystems such as ext4 or xfs will start a
transaction to store inode in the journal. This gets freeze protection at
SB_FREEZE_FS level again. If freeze_super() sets s_writers.frozen to
SB_FREEZE_FS before this second protection, things will deadlock.

Since the callers of this function hold mmap_sem, using SB_FREEZE_PAGEFAULT
protection would be appropriate. Also since there are just two places that
need the freeze protection I'd be inclined to open code the protection in
the two places rather than hiding it in a special function.
