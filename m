This is normal desktop usage with some development thrown in, nothing
spectacular but nothing obviously reproducible either unfortuantely. I
just noticed that some git operations were taking abnormally long, mutt
was very slow opening mail, applications like mozilla were very slow to
launch etc. and dug a little further. I haven't checked if regression
tests under mmtests captured something similar yet.
