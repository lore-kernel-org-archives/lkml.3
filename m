Please be more clear.  What do you mean by these statements?  That
someone privately reported that your earlier patch [1] did not help
them, but applying your new patch [2] on top of the old patch did?

[1] http://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=138418996717941&w=2
[2] http://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=138996538403468&w=2

In general, will you please Cc me and the USB list when replying to
privately reported bugs/confirmations that patches work?  Or if the
confirmation was reported, please provide a link to the mailing list
discussion or bugzilla entry.  We need to keep bug and fix confirmations
publicly archived.  Please keep me on Cc since I filter mail based on
that.

Why?  Walt has a 0.96 xHCI host controller, and the format for how to
calculate the TD remainder changed between the 0.96 and the 1.0 spec.
That's why we have xhci_v1_0_td_remainder() and xhci_td_remainder().
