You've missed an awful lot more than just the implications for the
core kernel code.

There's a good chance such changes propagate to APIs elsewhere in
the filesystems, because something you haven't realised is that XFS
effectively exposes the on-disk timestamp format directly to
userspace via the bulkstat interface (see struct xfs_bstat). It also
affects the XFS open-by-handle ioctl and the swap extent ioctl used
by the online defragmenter.

IOWs, if we are changing the on-disk timestamp format then this
affects several ioctl()s and hence quite a few of the XFS userspace
utilities. The hardest to fix will be xfsdump which would need a new
dump format to store the extended timestamp ranges, and then
xfs_restore will need to be able to handle restoring such timestamps
on filesystems that don't have extended timestamp support...

Put simply, changing the structure of system time isn't as straight
forward as changing the kernel structures. System time gets stored
permanently, and that has a cascade effect through the kernel all
to all of the filesystem utilities that know about that permanent
storage in some way....

So yes, you can change the kernel definition, but until the
permanent storage of system time can be extended to support the same
range as the kernel the *system* will still have nasty, silent epoch
overflow, truncation or corruption issues.

"nothing should change" except for the fact that a 64 bit timestamp
gets silently truncated to 32 bits and the timestamp is not what the
user expects it to be. The user does not find out until the inode
passes out of cache and is re-read from disk, and then it's wrong.

To put it politely: that is broken, obnoxious behaviour and we don't
design new interfaces with such ugly warts anymore. Define an
EOVERFLOW, EINVAL or ERANGE error in the new syscalls to handle this
case and *hard fail* if the storage cannot support the extended
timestamp being passed in. There is no excuse for silently mangling
out-of-range data, especially as we have plenty of time to add
support to the filesystems so that such errors don't occur. It might
take us a year to implement, but it will be done long before the
epoch overflows.

And, FWIW, this patchset needs a set of regression tests that ensure
timestamps beyond 2038 and 2106 don't change across unmount/mount.
Written for xfstests, preferably, so that it's run as part of every
filesystem developer's daily workflow. This is the only way we are
going to ensure that the filesystem and VFS code works correctly and
continues to work correctly up to the end of the current epoch....

Cheers,

Dave.
