Yes, specifically (finally done bisecting):

commit 2e45528930388658603ea24d49cf52867b928d3e
Author: Jiang Liu <jiang.liu@linux.intel.com>
Date:   Wed Feb 19 14:07:36 2014 +0800

    iommu/vt-d: Unify the way to process DMAR device scope array
    
    Now we have a PCI bus notification based mechanism to update DMAR
    device scope array, we could extend the mechanism to support boot
    time initialization too, which will help to unify and simplify
    the implementation.
