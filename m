From: "Frank S. Filz" <ffilzlnx@mindspring.com>

The NFS v4 client sends a COMPOUND with an OPEN and an ACCESS.

The ACCESS is required to verify an open for read is actually
allowed because RFC 3530 indicates OPEN for read only must succeed
for an execute only file.

The old code expected to have read access if the requested access
was O_RDWR.

We can expect the OPEN to properly permission check as long as
the open is O_WRONLY or O_RDWR.
