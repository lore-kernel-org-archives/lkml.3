There's no "bug" in udevadm, the user explicitly asked for it to read
all of those files.  Just like grep or bash could be used to ask to read
those files.

If the kernel is going to provide files to userspace, the kernel can't
suddenly get upset if userspace actually reads those files.

Fix the kernel here please.

Yes, this is a good solution.

Also a good solution.
