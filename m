Thanks. Nice summary.

(Thanks for the reminder on that last point.)

Can you explain what you mean by "more predictable"? It's not clear to me.

3 * yes is nice!

For which of the above 3 questions was the answer "No" with the
previous version of these patches (the version that specified queue
selection in pread())?

So, the 'offset' argument of pread() is interpreted by considering the
per-thread and shared queue as one concatenated list, right?

If yes to the previous question, then from an API design point of view
that seems odd: it exposes an implementation detail. Is specifying
both SFD_PER_THREAD_QUEUE and SFD_SHARED_QUEUE usefule for
checkpoint/restore? I almost wonder if, when SFD_PEEK is specified, a
requirement should be enforced that SFD_PER_THREAD_QUEUE or
SFD_SHARED_QUEUE, but not both, must be specified. What do you think?

Thanks,

Michael
