Given how new it is, I was shy to suggest it. Anything needed the new
features (TSYNC) obviously must use it, but it'll be a while before
this syscall is in distros. I think it should be used over prctl, but
there's no strong reason to change existing code.

It's not required for this example, but anything uses the
SECCOMP_RET_TRACE returns, it'll want it. And given the mention of
things like PTRACE_O_TRACESECCOMP, it seemed like we should include
the #include. I'll leave it to your discretion on what's appropriate
for a man-page header, though. :)

Yeah, "task" should be avoided, my mistake! I will try to correct them
below. The above general case is correct, since TSYNC can change the
state on all threads of the process.

Should this be clarified to "the calling thread", or is that implied?

"signal" needs a period ending the sentence above.

To me, "and system calls" implies something other than filters. Maybe:
"the same system call filters as the parent"?

Perhaps "Similarly, if execve is allowed, the existing filters will be
preserved across the call to execve." The filter _is_ the "constraints
on permitted system calls", but since it can do more than constrain,
I'm shy to imply a limit to the scope of this description.

Strictly speaking, if any ancestor ever called PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS,
the process already has it set. Perhaps "... capability, or the thread
must already have thew "no new privs" prctl bit set. If not already
set by an ancestory, the thread must call: ..."

Andy mentioned the "why", but "installed" here means "called seccomp()
to add filters", e.g. add (install) a filter to have
"setuid(non-root)" return 0 instead of actually getting called, and
then exec a setuid process that tries to drop privileges, which
doesn't happen, and now the original caller (non-root) has a setuid
process running as root that it may be able to influence into doing
dangerous things because it didn't _actually_ drop privileges.

Strictly speaking, "process" -> "thread"

As Andy said, the list of filters attached to the process. A process
may have multiple threads adding filters, which would cause those
threads to have separate branches of seccomp filters (though they
would share a common root from when the process started). It is only
possible to use TSYNC if threads haven't diverged in this way.

They are executed in reverse order (most recently added is executed first).

Correct. All filters are executed. The returned value is the one with
the first seen highest priority (lowest numerical value) action of
those returned by each filter. For example, if a filter was installed
that returned SECCOMP_RET_ERRNO|1, and then another filter installed
SECCOMP_RET_ERRNO|22, and then another filter installed
SECCOMP_RET_ALLOW, SECCOMP_RET_ERRNO|22 would be returned.
SECCOMP_RET_ERRNO is higher priority than SECCOMP_RET_ALLOW, but since
the SECCOMP_RET_ERRNO|22 was seen first, it's data (22) will be used,
even though the last filter returned a lower data (1), as only action
values are compared.

> A seccomp filter returns one of the values listed below.

Based on discussion further below, perhaps "value" should be called
"action" here? Maybe:

A seccomp filter returns a value. The high 16 bits
(SECCOMP_RET_ACTION) is the seccomp filter "action" to take. The low
16 bits (SECCOMP_RET_DATA) is data specific to the action.

How should these be detailed? (I took a stab at it further above.)
#define SECCOMP_RET_ACTION      0x7fff0000U
#define SECCOMP_RET_DATA        0x0000ffffU

The above tries to document what was mentioned about the order of

It it worth showing where you got the 0xC000003E value from? (i.e.
from just running ./a.out and looking at its hints)
