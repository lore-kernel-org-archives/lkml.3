The way I read this is that there will (probably) be a handful of
users, namely the existing dbus libraries: libdus, sd-bus, glib, Qt,
ell, and maybe a few others. However, third-party developers will not
know/care about the details of kdbus, they'll just be coding against
the dbus libraries as before (might be minor changes, but they
certainly won't need to know anything about the kernel API). Similarly
to how userspace developers now code against their libc of choice,
rather than use kernel syscalls directly.

HTH,

Tom
