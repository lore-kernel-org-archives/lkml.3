Yes, metadata changes are serialized and and they depends on data commits,
thus block layer cannot delay write requests without introducing nasty priority
inversions. Cached read requests cannot be delayed at all. All solutions either
breaks throttling or adds PI. So block layer is just wrong place for this.

If we want to control writeback speed we also must control size of dirty set.
There are several possibilities: we either can start writeback earlier,
or when dirty set exceeds some threshold we will start charging that dirty
memory into throttler and slow down all tasks who generates this dirty memory.
Because dirty memory is charged and accounted we can write it without delays.

Currently I'm thinking about per-cgroup X per-tier. Each bdi will be assigned
to some tier. It's flexible enough and solves chicken-and-egg problem:
when disk appears it will be assigned to default tier and can be reassigned.
