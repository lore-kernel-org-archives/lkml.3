Hi Dave

Thanks for reporting this.

Could you please share your test case with me? I am glad to look at it
and think about how to improve LRU locking.

A proper in-order LRU can help us to reclaim some memory from extent
status tree when we are under heavy memory pressure.  When shrinker
tries to reclaim extents from these trees, some extents of files that
are accessed infrequnetly will be reclaimed because we hope that
frequently accessed files' extents can be kept in memory as much as
possible.  That is why we need a proper in-order LRU list.
