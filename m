Further testing suggests this patch on the sg driver is
broken, so I'll rescind my ack.

The case it is broken for is when a device is opened
without O_EXCL. Now if, while it is open, a second
thread/process tries to open the same device O_EXCL
then IMO the second open should fail with EBUSY.

My testing shows that O_EXCL opens properly deflect
other O_EXCL opens.

BTW the standard block driver (e.g. /dev/sdc) is broken
in exactly the same way, according to my tests.
