So is this hypothetical or do you have a real customer in mind?  If
it's not theoretical, how does the cloud service control who has
access to the CD burner, and how are the disks loaded into the CD
burner?  Trying to do it where you run cdrecord from the guest OS
sounds **insane**.  The far better way of doing things is to export a
web service where you ship a iso image plus a shipping address to a
burn service, and you don't try to figure out how to make dozens of VM
on a cloud server share a physical CD burner attached to a physical
host OS.  That way leads to insanity.
