I don't think anyone's arguing that you can't do this.  The argument is
more you shouldn't: Lock contention is one of the biggest killers of
performance and getting locking right (avoiding inversions, or even
nested locks at all) is hard.  Therefore you need to keep the shortest
and clearest critical sections in Linux that you can, so the pattern for
locking is to lock and unlock in the same routine with a local flags
variable.

So, rather than develop a primitive that supports and encourages uses of
locking that violate the pattern and is far more likely to cause
performance and other problems, could you just audit the code to see if
the need to carry a lock across a routine could be eliminated (either by
shortening the critical section or by better nesting the calls).

Thanks,

James
