Adding that to the docco might be useful ;)

Ok, so it hasn't changed. We're still usingthem like we used the
original workqueues, and we never, ever provided a guarantee of
forwards progress for them, either. So if the workqueues haven't
changed, and we haven't changed how we use workqueues, then
something else is causing all our recent problems....

Thanks for the clarification, Tejun!

Cheers,

Dave.
