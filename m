Hi,

CC guys who introduced the lockdep change.

At least this may deadlock another mount.nfs during freezing, :-)

See detailed explanation in the commit log:

    lockdep: check that no locks held at freeze time

    We shouldn't try_to_freeze if locks are held.  Holding a lock can cause a
    deadlock if the lock is later acquired in the suspend or hibernate path
    (e.g.  by dpm).  Holding a lock can also cause a deadlock in the case of
    cgroup_freezer if a lock is held inside a frozen cgroup that is later
    acquired by a process outside that group.
