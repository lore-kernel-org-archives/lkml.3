It's a matter of keeping changes together so they could be run from a
single branch, without having to merge the entirety of scsi.git in order
to test a new target features involving some manner of LLD changes.

Stuff like the qla2xxx target T10 PI where OK to go through scsi.git,
because they really didn't depend on target changes, but for things like
virtio-scsi + vhost-scsi T10 PI, or the iser-initiator + iser-target T10
PI data_length changes where one can't function without the other,
breaking up initiator / target patches across trees will just end up
making my work-flow unnecessarily more difficult.

I'd say identifying these types of merge conflicts is what linux-next is
supposed to be for, and at least this time around the conflicts ended up
being straight-forward to resolve with srf's patches.
