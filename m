This is the main (actually only) justification for the patch, and it it
far too thin.  What does "not needed" mean.  Why can't people just use
/proc/pid/maps?

hm, who's that.  Kees comes to mind.

And reviewers' task would be a heck of a lot easier if they knew what
/proc/pid/map_files actually does.  This:

akpm3:/usr/src/25> grep -r map_files Documentation 
akpm3:/usr/src/25> 

does not help.

The 640708a2cff7f81 changelog says:

:     This one behaves similarly to the /proc/<pid>/fd/ one - it contains
:     symlinks one for each mapping with file, the name of a symlink is
:     "vma->vm_start-vma->vm_end", the target is the file.  Opening a symlink
:     results in a file that point exactly to the same inode as them vma's one.
:     
:     For example the ls -l of some arbitrary /proc/<pid>/map_files/
:

afacit this info is also available in /proc/pid/maps, so things
shouldn't get worse if the /proc/pid/map_files permissions are at least
as restrictive as the /proc/pid/maps permissions.  Is that the case? 
(Please add to changelog).


There's one other problem here: we're assuming that the map_files
implementation doesn't have bugs.  If it does have bugs then relaxing
permissions like this will create new vulnerabilities.  And the
map_files implementation is surprisingly complex.  Is it bug-free?
