Thanks!

I suspect you'll get a lot of "(unreachable)/foo/bar".

I'll see if I can get highpid in soon enough that starttime can be
dropped entirely.  Once it shows up, there will be an API that can
probably never be removed that isn't namespaced correctly and can't be
checkpointed.

I still don't expect this metadata item to ever make sense to use.
The best argument I've heard is that it would enable CAP_SYS_BOOT to
ask systemd for a reboot.  I think this is bogus:

Realistically, this probably just means that users of /sbin/reboot
might continue to work as expected.  Except:

1. CAP_SYS_BOOT was never sufficient for /sbin/reboot to reboot
cleanly -- clean reboots historically went through /dev/initctl.

2. This only makes sense anyway if /sbin/reboot gets updated to speak
dbus.  So you have a new reboot binary that you want to work as long
as it ends up with CAP_SYS_BOOT.  But caps are so broken that this
won't work intelligently no matter what kdbus does.  A user can have
CAP_SYS_BOOT or not, but whether or not /sbin/reboot inherits that bit
is almost entirely a function of that user's euid and has very little
to do with whether that user has CAP_SYS_BOOT.  So you might as well
just check euid == 0 in the first place.

And setting fscap bits on /sbin/reboot so that a new reboot binary can
prove to systemd that it has CAP_SYS_BOOT makes no sense.  Either put
the policy in systemd in the first place, or make /sbin/reboot setuid
root.

And passing the permitted, inheritable, and bounding sets makes even
less sense.  Yes, you could pass the entirety of /proc/PID/stat and
/proc/PID/status, but that's silly, and passing caps around via kdbus
for diagnostics seems ridiculous.

If you put it in now, it's here to stay even if it proves to be a bad
idea, whereas if you don't put it in at first, you can always add it
if a good reason comes up.

I don't expect this to become a problem.

Yeah, but what happens on systems that use a different LSM?  And isn't
the point of the new LSM kdbus hooks to do this automatically without
userspace's help?

Admittedly, I don't see much of a problem with this feature existing,
as long as the non-selinux people are okay with it.

And thanks for addressing most of the issues.  The code is starting to
look much better to me.
