There's a little bit of discussion in rights.7 (mail 3/5 of the
man-pages set), but there isn't a structure description.

I was trying to keep the structure opaque to userspace, which would
be expected to manipulate the rights with various utility functions
rather than directly.

But I now realize this leaves a gap -- the description of this syscall
doesn't include a full description of its ABI.

So I'll add in a description of the structure to this page -- basically:

  struct cap_rights {
  	__u64	cr_rights[2];
  };

with a slightly complicated scheme to encode rights into the bitmask
array.  (The encoding scheme is taken from the FreeBSD implementation,
which I've tried to stick to unless there's good reason to change.)

The locking operations are policed against a separate CAP_FLOCK right,
consistently with flock(2).  I'll try to improve the wording -- there
are actually a few fcntl operations that are covered by different
rights because they're analogous to other functionality (e.g.
F_GETPIPE_SZ/F_SETPIPE_SZ needs CAP_GETSOCKOPT/CAP_SETSOCKOPT).
