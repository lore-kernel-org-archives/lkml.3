Yep. It is not on the top of my head, but I remember something like INQUIRYs
are emulated and thus do not have payload.

Yep. Because blk_execute_rq() does not put the proper callback and data do
not get copied from sg's to bounce buffer. That is why I tried to use
blk_mq_execute_rq() instead. Once I do that, data start getting read and
booting stops elsewhere.

Of course, I was suspecting that change alone is not valid and wondered
about the status of scsi-mq in the first place, and if more changes are
coming.

So I it turns out "req->errors + req->resid_len" issue (you described
earlier) needs to be addressed before going forward with libata (only?).

Bio buffers do not get updated from callback.

Thanks a lot for these and other your comments, Nicholas!
