  OK, so I finally nailed this down. DIO code has that peculiarity that it
doesn't call ->end_io callback when no IO was actually submitted. As a
bonus the generic code does a cleanup of generic stuff that is otherwise left
to ->end_io callback. Since I need to do io_end cleanup in ->end_io callback
I have to compensate for that in ext4_ext_direct_IO(). Sadly I've got the
condition wrong and also forgot that generic code already decremented
i_dio_count in the error failure case so cleanup sometimes happened twice.
I'll add fixed version of the patch back in my series (since the patch got
reverted upstream).
