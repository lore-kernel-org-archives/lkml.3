Now CFQ also dynamically adjusts the slice length based on the how
many queues are ready to do IO. One problem with fixed slice lenth
round robin was that if there are lot of queues doing IO, then after
serving one queue, same queue will get time slice after a long time.

Corrado Zoccolo did work in this area in an attempt to improve latency.
Now slice length is calculated dynamically in an attempt to achieve
better latency.

Ok, so you prefer to have another IO scheduler instead of improving
CFQ?

Tejun, I have spent significant amount of time on BFQ few years ago. And
that's the reason I have not read it again yet. My understanding was
that there was nothing which would not be done in CFQ (atleast things
which mattered).

Looks like you prefer introducing a new scheduler instead of improving
CFQ. My preference is to improve CFQ. Borrow good ideas from BFQ and
implement them in CFQ.

We primarily allow preemption of buffered write queue. If you allocate
a share for buffered write queue, that would be good for not starving
buffered writes but your read latencies should go down.

So why not improve CFQ instead of carrying and maintaining another 
scheduler. And then have a discussion that what's the default scheduler.

If plan is that BFQ is better than CFQ and instead of fixing CFQ lets
introduce BFQ and slowly phase out CFQ, please say so.

There is alredy lot of confusion in terms of explaining to people what
IO scheduler to use and now there is another one in the mix which is
almost same as CFQ but supposedely performs better.

Thanks
