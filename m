I grabbed this and queued it for 3.13-rc1, marked for backporting into
-stable.  Given the amount of churn on this one I think it would be
imprudent to put it into mainline immediately.

I haven't been following the discussion very closely, so if anyone
thinks it should be ungrabbed, please speak up.
