Heh. The conflict was trivial, and git does 99% of it automatically -
leaving just the header file inclusions to be resolved manually
because they were right next to each other. The resolution just looks
scarier than it is because there were other changes that did resolve
cleanly, but that were "close enough" to each other that the context
overlapped, so they are shown too..

But yes, had it actually been complicated, I'd probably still have
done it, and perhaps asked you to verify it. We did have a couple of
more serious conflicts in this merge window.
