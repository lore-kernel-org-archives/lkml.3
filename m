Which is how is should be. ;) All I want is some kind of
notification when a CVE raised for an XFS issue. It may be telling
us something we already known, but if:

	a) it has not yet been pushed upstream; or
	b) it was not marked for stable kernels at commit time; or
	c) don't have a fix for it yet

then it's an indication that we need to pay a little more attention
to this class of problem when we review similar fixes.

Right - this falls into the above category a) because of that. There
didn't appear to be any urgency because of the level of exposure of
the problem (i.e. need CAP_SYS_ADMIN to trip over it) and the fact
it's been like this for the past 10 years....

Well, it may not be known at the time it's considered a security
issue, so I think that the best thing to do is make sure that when
a CVE is actually raise a note is sent to the relevant list just to
indicate 'CVE 1024-3267 has been raised for commit abcd1234
("xfs: knabgraddle the frobnozzle")'.

At least that way everyone - including XFS users - that there is an
issue that they might want to look out for and plan to upgrade their
stable kernels in the not-to-distant future...

Cheers,

Dave.
