Well, my fault for not reviewing the patch, I saw it and didn't give it
more than a skim.  Not sure I would have caught that, though.

The only thing I can think of that might have made it easier to catch
was breaking up the patch (v4 could probably have been done separately
from v2/v3?).  But I still probably would've overlooked it....
