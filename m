Hi Linus,

I reworked my trees to remove the cleanups and a few of the fixes that
were doing larger surgery.  This cut the pull in half, and I've pushed
it out to my integration branch.

Almost all of them are fit for an rc2 or rc3, so I've shelved most of it
for later.  I'll go through again and rip a few more of them out for
the next merge window.

I also rebased and retested 9 of these that I'd like to see in
sooner.  They are all fixes I'd like to get out to a broader audience.

The biggest of the bunch is Mark's quota fix, which is also in the SUSE
kernel, and makes our subvolume quotas dramatically more accurate.

I've been running xfstests with these against your current git
overnight, but I'm queueing up longer tests as well.  I understand
you may want to wait until rc2, but either way I'll get a sane queue
into my linux-next branch for the rest of the rcs.

These are all in my for-linus2 branch:
