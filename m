The most obvious problem I can think of with "do whatever" is that this
will likely include mknod of char and block devices which you can then
chown/chmod as you wish and use to access any devices on the system from
an unprivileged container.
This can however be mitigated by using the devices cgroup controller.

You also probably wouldn't want any unprivileged user from the host to
find a way to access that mounted filesytem but so long as you do the
mount in a separate mountns and don't share uids between the host and
the container, that should be fine too.
