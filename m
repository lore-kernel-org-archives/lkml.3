The rights encoding scheme is supposed to cope with extensions, so let me
have a go at explaining it.

The size of the array in the structure can potentially change in future,
so a less abbreviated version is:

  #define CAP_RIGHTS_VERSION_00   0
  #define CAP_RIGHTS_VERSION_01   1
  #define CAP_RIGHTS_VERSION_02   2
  #define CAP_RIGHTS_VERSION_03   3
  #define CAP_RIGHTS_VERSION      CAP_RIGHTS_VERSION_00
  struct cap_rights {
      uint64_t cr_rights[CAP_RIGHTS_VERSION + 2];
  };

The encoding rules are then:
 - There are between 2 and 5 entries in the array.
 - The number of entries in the array is indicated by the top 2 bits of
   cr_rights[0] (as array size minus 2); this allows for future
   expansion (up to 285 distinct rights):
     0b00 = 2 entries
     0b01 = 3 entries
     0b10 = 4 entries
     0b11 = 5 entries
 - The top 2 bits of cr_rights[i] are 0b00 for i>0.
 - The next 5 bits of each array entry indicate its position in the
   array:
     0b00001 for cr_rights[0]
     0b00010 for cr_rights[1]
     0b00100 for cr_rights[2]
     0b01000 for cr_rights[3]
     0b10000 for cr_rights[4]
 - The remaining 57 bits of each entry are used to hold rights values,
   so the current structure can hold 114 rights, and the maximum is
   285.

So a future kernel (with an expanded array) can cope with an old binary
(that uses a narrow array) by reading the first u64 from the structure,
and using the top 2 bits to figure out how much more memory to copy
from userspace.  Slightly inefficient, but I wouldn't expect rights
setting to be a performance critical operation.

Of course, we can deviate from the FreeBSD implementation details if
we want to -- these details are deliberately hidden from userspace
programs in the rights-manipulation library functions, so a different
implementation under the covers wouldn't affect Capsicum-using
applications.  But I figured it's best to stay close unless there's
a good reason to diverge.
