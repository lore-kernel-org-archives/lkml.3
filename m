Hello, Paolo.

So, that's where we differ, I guess.  When it comes to hardware
devices, especially the ones as widely and cheaply deployed as SCSI or
ATA, my common sense screams to stick to what's known to work and
don't venture outside unnecessarily.

You're grepping for known irregularities which need to be used to make
the device work.  Just read through, say, sd driver code and see how
hard it tries to stick to what's known to work rather than venturing
out to the space allowed by the spec.

The default approach in this area definitely is and should be
conservative in general.

No, we don't know it's gonna be harmless.  How do we *know* that
outside of the naive expectation that devices are gonna safely and
sanely ignore things that they don't understand?

I don't think it's gonna be that many iterations and would much prefer
doing several iterations and having the backing data for each command
added.

Thanks.
