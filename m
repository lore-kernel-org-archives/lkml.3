Hello,

Yes, similar with your understanding.

With current CMA implementation, page allocator doesn't returns
freepages in CMA reserved region until there is no freepage of movable
type. If there is no freepage of movable type, freepages in CMA reserved
region is allocated via fallback allocation. This approach is simliar
with what you suggested.

In that situation, kswapd would start to reclaim because free memory
is already too low. By this reclaim, freepages of movable type are
refilled and page allocator would stop to allocate freepages in CMA
reserved region. So, with above approach, system would work as if
it has only (total memory - CMA reserved memory) memory.

CMA is intended for using reserved memory on general purpose when
reserved memory isn't used. But current implementation don't do that.
My patch fixes this situation by allocating freepages in CMA reserved
region aggrressively.

I also test another approach, such as allocate freepage in CMA
reserved region as late as possible, which is also similar to your
suggestion and this doesn't works well. When reclaim is started,
too many pages reclaim at once, because lru list has successive pages
in CMA region and these doesn't help kswapd's reclaim. kswapd stop
reclaiming when freepage count is recovered. But, CMA pages isn't
counted for freepage for kswapd because they can't be usable for
unmovable, reclaimable allocation. So kswap reclaim too many pages
at once unnecessarilly.

More detailed explanation may be in following link.

Thanks.
