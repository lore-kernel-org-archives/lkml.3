I set the sector size as 4096 when making the xfs filesystem.
-sh-4.1# mkfs.xfs -s size=4096 -f /dev/sda3

In this case, xlog_bread_noalign() needs to do such round up and round down frequently. And it is used to ensure what it is passed is aligned to the log sector size, but not the device sector boundaries.

Here is the debug info I added when mounting this xfs partition.
-sh-4.1# mount /dev/sda3 /home/
XFS (sda3): Mounting Filesystem
xlog_bread_noalign:blk_no=0,nbblks=1,l_sectBBsize=8
xlog_bread_noalign:blk_no=61447,nbblks=1,l_sectBBsize=8
xlog_bread_noalign:blk_no=0,nbblks=1,l_sectBBsize=8
.......
xlog_bread_noalign:blk_no=8695,nbblks=1,l_sectBBsize=8
xlog_bread_noalign:blk_no=4600,nbblks=4096,l_sectBBsize=8
xlog_bread_noalign:blk_no=8184,nbblks=512,l_sectBBsize=8

While debugging, I found when it crashed, the blk_no was not align to the log sector size and nnblks was aligned to the log sector size, which makes sense.

For example, if xlog_bread_noalign() wants to read blocks from #1 to # 9, in which case the passed parameter blk_no is 1, and nbblks is 8, sectBBsize is 8, after the round down and round up operations, we get blk_no as 0, and nbblks as still 8. We definitely lose the last block of the log data.

I was using the 2.6.38.6 kernel, and using xfs as a rootfs partition. After untaring the rootfs files on the xfs partition, and tried to reboot from the xfs, then the panic occasionally occurred.

I hope I can provide the corrupted log for you, but probably I could not find it, since I fixed this bug a year ago. Recently when I do some clean-up on my code, I find this one, so I think I should return it back to the community.

Good catch, you are right on this. To avoid this possibility, I changed the patch a little bit as following.
