I'll try to find the docs for this.  It sounds potentially quite helpful.

This is IMO not correct.  Linux namespaces have survived this long
without having names, for good reason: it avoids ever dealing with how
to name them.

And just loosening the permissions allows anyone to pollute their
kdbus domain hierarchy, and, possibly worse, make those names visible
outside their new domain.  This is done for the questionable gain of
using device nodes.

But it *is* intended to be used between app containers.  Given that
this is an explicit design goal, I think that someone should really
clarify how the design is compatible with the goal.  "Systemd can do
it" may or may not be a true statement, but it isn't a useful
statement for reviewers.

You don't have this avenue to open it up later.  Someone will,
correctly, rely on this suppression to provide anonymity, and, when
you turn it off, you will introduce security holes.

nspawn is a great development tool.  It's not such a good test bed for
more complicated use cases, especially since it appears to completely
lack user namespace support.

How does that work?  What is systemd doing to prevent containerized
things from seeing the full view of kdbus?

My media player does not need to generate audit records.  Nor does my
screensaver, and, for that matter, nor do most genuine system
services.
