Oh, good.  If that works, Steve might want to look back at how that
array size was chosen?  I seem to recall there being some compromise due
to this array being on the stack, and that there might have been some
performance advantage to increasing it further, but I can't find the bug
right now....  (And I might be misremembering.)
