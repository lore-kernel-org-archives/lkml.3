It would be nice to see the whole solution, together with the btrfs patch.

The problem I have is that this new primitive is only superficially like 
spin_is_contended(): in the spinlock case dropping the lock will guarantee 
some sort of progress, because another CPU will almost certainly pick up 
the lock if we cpu_relax().

In the rwsem case there's no such guarantee of progress, especially if a 
read-lock is dropped. So I'd like to see how it's implemented in practice.

Thanks,

	Ingo
