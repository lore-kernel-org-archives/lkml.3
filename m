I guess my patches could be extended to do this.  In their current
form, when a pte dirty bit is transferred to a page (via page_mkclean
or unmap), the address_space is marked as needed a cmtime update.  I
could add a mode in which even the normal write syscall path sets that
bit instead of immediately updating the timestamp.  This could be a
nice speedup to non-mmap writers.

To avoid breaking things, things like fsync would need to force a
cmtime flush -- I doubt it would be okay for write; fsync; write;
fsync to leave the timestamp matching the first write.

I'd rather get comments on the current form of my patches and maybe
get them merged before looking at even more far-reaching extensions,
though.
