Right, what a pity... thanks for the hint.

But the code is really simple if we ignore this problem(with some proper
modifications to scsi bus PM callbacks, see the delayed_resume branch if
you are interested), so I'm tempted to post it here :-)

Below branch has all the code necessary to try this out:
https://github.com/aaronlu/linux.git delayed_resume

And you will have to enable runtime PM for both ata port and scsi device,
it works for HDD and normal ODD(ZPODD needs some extra work), tested on
my thinkpad R61i with a HDD and an ODD.

But yeah, as Alan has said, this can't be a general solution.
But someday it may be, when CONFIG_RUNTIME_PM and CONFIG_PM_SLEEP are
regarded as base functions of the kernel and always compiled in :-)

Sorry for the noise.
