You rebased the tree before doing it ... that's the one thing that
excites his process gene.  I can't send a rebased tree in on the last
day of merging.

I'll send in the unrebased tree which has been sitting in linux-next for
the past week.  The two additional changes in core-for-3.17 can be
picked out and sent as eligible bug fixes for -rc1.  The only addition
in drivers-for-3.17 is eata: remove driver_lock ... I'm in two minds
about whether we treat that as a bug fix or not.
