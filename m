Correct.

Right.  As I mentioned in the case of 32-bit x86 dumpfiles, there is no automation
available when CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START is larger than CONFIG_PHYSICAL_ALIGN.  The user
either has to be aware of their values in order to calculate the --reloc argument,
or has to capture a copy of the /proc/kallsyms file on the crashed system.  Typically
users/distros using kdump changed their x86 configurations to avoid having to deal
with that.

But how would that differ from using an incorrect (non-matching) vmlinux file?
