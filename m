Of course I wasn't advocating deliberately breaking old drivers. But
it's easy to get annoyed by that short remark. It would have been better
if I hadn't made it.

Especially because I didn't also point out, as Cristoph did, that the
code I want removed doesn't get compiled. So removing it can, by
definition I'd say, not break that old driver.

Sure. See my recent patch to scripts/headers_check.pl, which does just
that. But before one special cases a certain hit for a checker one needs
to know that this hit really can't or won't be fixed. And in order to
know that one needs to at least try to fix it first.

Fair point: having code that no one uses doesn't cost a lot.

I never really touched IDE. That might explain why I only ran into this
issue with SCSI.

Thanks for taking the time to explain this to me. I appreciate that.
This is the first time, I think, that I've seen you explain that policy.
(I might have missed earlier explanations to other people.) Now I might
not entirely agree with you, but it does help to know where you're
coming from.

Thanks,
