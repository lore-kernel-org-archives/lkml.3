Ok, I see.

Of course, "most filesystems" are obsolete, and most of the modern
file systems already support >32 bit timestamps: ext4, btrfs, cifs,
f2fs, 9p, nfsv4, ntfs, gfs2, ocfs2, fuse, ufs2. Everything else
except xfs, ext2/3 and exofs uses the nfsv3 interpretation on
64-bit systems, which interprets time stamps with the high bit
set as years 2038-2106 rather than 1903-1969.

We already have that. I agree it's fixable and we should fix it,
but I don't see how this is different from what we had 20 years
ago when Linux on Alpha first introduced a 64-bit time_t. It's
been this way on every 64-bit Linux system since.

Ok, fair enough.
