We can (and even for MMC) if it is a build-time configuration knob.  It
would satisfy those people who want the CVE fixed, as long as userspace
gets some configurability.

That's not possible; it would make it impossible to do things like using
a privileged helper to open the file and passing it back via SCM_RIGHTS
to an unprivileged program (running as the user).  This is the ptrace
attack that you mentioned.
