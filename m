I believe the reason pci_vfs_assigned() and the pci_dev flag that backs
it exists is because legacy KVM device assignment does not require a
host driver for the device.  At best, the assigned device is bound to
pci-stub, which is more than happy to release a device at any point in
time.  This flag was therefore added to indicate that the device was in
use, please don't make it disappear.  With VFIO, the device is bound to
vfio-pci in the host which will only release the device when it is
unused, just like any other device driver.  If the device is in use,
either assigned to a VM or otherwise in use by a userspace driver,
vfio-pci will block until unused.

There are opportunities that we have yet to implement that we could
notify the user of the removal request, triggering a hot-unplug in a
guest.  Assuming some sort of revoke() functionality gets pushed
upstream we could also make an unplug request, wait from some time, then
revoke the device from the user.  The point however is that device
assignment shouldn't be handled as a special case.  When
pci_disable_sriov() is called, the release functions for any drivers
owning an affected VF should be called where we have the opportunity to
block until unused.  Thanks,

Alex
