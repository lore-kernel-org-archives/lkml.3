Right, a bunch of DDing from /dev/zero over an ssh session triggers this
very quickly. I've put a binary tcpdump here:

  http://www.willdeacon.ukfsn.org/bitbucket/oopsen/nfs/tcpdump.bin

You may want to filter out the ssh packets. The only `interesting' thing to
me is a retransmission about half way through, but I don't know what I'm
looking for.

The NFS server is 10.1.203.204 and the client is 10.1.203.24.
