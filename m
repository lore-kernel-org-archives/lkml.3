It's the extending of locks over other locks that make aspects of this
series problematic to existing code.  Please run them with lock
debugging on and perform a few active I/O shutdowns and you'll see what
I mean.

Not to mention the patches with the locking changes mix cleanups with
bug-fixes, which I really dislike when reviewing patches of this nature.

Like I said, I don't agree this is the best way to get to something
smarter.

I'm currently reviewing #2, #4, #5 and #7 and will consider merging
these.  These cleanups account for most of the LOC reduction, and avoid
most of the larger concerns.

Also for patches like this, they really need testing on your end before
I'll consider them merging.  Compile testing alone for these types of
locking changes is not enough, given the history of regressions with
these types of cleanups.

Thanks,
