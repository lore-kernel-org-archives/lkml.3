Subject: [Resend] [PATCH 0/2] procfs: make /proc/*/{stack,syscall,pagemap} 0400
Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2013 19:57:12 +0100
Message-Id: <1387133834-31966-1-git-send-email-tixxdz@opendz.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 1.7.11.7
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The following patches make /proc/*/{stack,syscall,personality,pagemap}
0400.

These files contain sensitive information that can be used by an
unprivileged process to leak address space and bypass ASLR.


This is a resend, the original discussion:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/8/26/354

Ended by confirming this, and Kees Cook Acked the first patch.

Kees Cook also confirmed the security exposure here:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/8/28/564


So these patches only restore the original 0400 mode that will make
the VFS able to block unprivileged processes from getting file
descriptors on arbitrary privileged
/proc/*/{stack,syscall,personality,pagemap} files.


>From the first discussion no one picked the patches, so I included them
in the "procfs: protect /proc/*/* entries with file->f_cred" series:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/10/1/371

However, that attempt failed to have a general aggreemnt, so I'm
resending again but _only_ those two patches.

At least we have a VFS protection for now.
