I think "consumer" manager should delete its own cgroup directories when
associated consumer[s] stop running.

And partitions created by workman will just remain there until and unless
user wanted to delete these explicitly.

I am not sure about this. I guess when applications comes back after crash,
it can go through all the children cgroups and reclaim empty cgroups.

A centralized authority does not know about all the managed objects.
Only respective manager knows about what objects it is managing and
what are the controllable attributes of that object.

systemd is managing services and libvirt is managing virtual machines,
containers etc. Some people view associated resource group as just one
additional attribute of the managed service. These managers already
maintain multiple attributes of a service and can store one additional
attribute easily.

May be. Just that in the past folks have not liked the idea of talking
to central authority to figure out resource group of an object they are
managing.

To me it makes sense in a way, as these resources associated with the
service is just one another property and there does not seem to be
anything special about this property that it should be managed using
a single centralized authority.

For example, one might want to say that maximum IO bandwidth for 
virtual machine virt1 on disk sda should be 10MB/s. Now libvirt
should be able to save it in virtual machine specific configuration
easily and whenever virtual machine is started, create a children
cgroup, set the limits as specified.

If a central authority keeps track of all this, I am not sure how 
would it look like and might get messy.

That would make sense. systemd had this conflict with cgconfig
too. Problem is that systemd starts first and sets up everything. Now
if there is a service which sets up cgroups, after systemd startup,
it is already late.
