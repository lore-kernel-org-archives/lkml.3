Not really, I just have a tendency to overuse it sometimes. I could take 
those macros out.

Yes, the trylock function is somewhat unwieldy. Will integrate it back 
to the corresponding place. As a trylock, we usually do a read first to 
make sure that it is ready before doing cmpxchg. Blindly doing a cmpxhg 
unconditionally may hinder performance.

Yes, a timeout isn't supported yet. This is a RFC and I want to get a 
sense of how important a timeout will be before I add it in. I could 
certainly add that in if people think it is an important feature to have.

Sure. Will remove those unlikely() calls.

That comment was before I extracted the code out into a separate 
function. Will remove it.

If there is contention, the spin_lock() call may take a while. Unlike a 
wait-wake futex, the only uval that will be of interest is when the TID 
portion is 0. So we don't really need to pass in an uval. The uval is 
not 0 when the lock function is called. However, the lock owner may have 
released the lock by the time we check the futex value there before we 
go into spinning or waiting.

I just follow what has been done in the mutex code where preemption is 
disabled even in the sleeping loop.

Because the task is going to sleep and a queue node with the task 
pointer is going to be enqueued into the wait queue.

This is a good question. Do you have any suggestion on how to better 
handle error when get_user fails?

The get_futex_key(...., VERIFY_WRITE) call has check to make sure that 
the location is writeable and get_user() call has happened without 
error. What additional protection do you think we need here?

In patch 5, the documentation and the sample unlock does clear the TID 
before going in. The code here is just a safety measure in case the 
unlocker doesn't follow the recommendation.

The semantics of the uval is the same as that of PI and robust futex 
where the TID portion contains the thread ID of the lock owner. It is my 
intention to make it works with the robust futex mechanism before it can 
be merged. This RPC patch series is for soliciting feedbacks and make 
the necessary changes that make the patch acceptable before I go deep 
into making it works with robust futex.

As you have a lot more experience working with futexes than me, any 
suggestions on what kind of faults will happen and what are the best 
practices to handle them will be highly appreciated.
