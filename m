Out of curiosity, why does ext4 need to set up buffers?  That is, as
long as the fs can guarantee that there is reserved space to write out
the page, why isn't it sufficient to just mark the page dirty and let
the writeback code set up the buffers?

FWIW, back when I actually tested this stuff, I had awful performance
on XFS, btrfs, and ext4.  But I'm really only interested in the
whether IO (or waiting for contended locks) happens on faults or not
-- a handful of microseconds while the fs allocates something from a
slab doesn't really bother me.
