Thank you for the great effort you put into compiling the
text below, and apologies for my long delay in following up.

I've integrated almost all of your suggestions into the 
manual page. I will shortly send out a new draft of the
page that contains various FIXMEs for points that remain 
unclear.

Most of the rest of this mail is just a checklist noting
what I did with your comments. No response is needed 
in most cases, but there are a very few open questions in 
this mail that, to help you find them, I have marked with
"???". If you (or someone else) could reply to those, I 
would be grateful.

In the next day or two, I hope to send out the new version
of the futex(2) page for review. The new draft is a bit
bigger (okay -- 4 x bigger) than the current page. And there 
are a quite number of FIXMEs that I've placed in the page 
for various points--some minor, but a few major--that need
to be checked or fixed. Would you have some time to review
that page? 

For that matter, if anyone else would have time for
reviewing the page, could they shout out now. It's perhaps
unlikely, but I am worried about getting a thundering herd
of comments, and bringing the page to the state where I have 
it now has already been a fairly demanding task.

What I've actually done with the main text for FUTEX_REQUEUE is defer 
to the (now-expanded) discussion of FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE.

I had a read of Ulrich Drepper's "Futexes are Tricky", and the source 
code, and took a shot at it. I'd like to have someone check what 
I wrote though. See the draft that I will soon send out.

Added. Note, though, that some crufty code gives the impression
that FUTEX_LOCK_PI uses 'val'. I'll send a patch separately.

There is no such thing as an EOWNERDIED error. I had a look
through the kernel source for the FUTEX_OWNER_DIED cases and didn't 
see an obvious error associated with them. Can you clarify? (I think 
the point is that this condition, which is described in
Documentation/robust-futexes.txt, is not an error as such. However, I'm
not yet sure of how to describe it in the man page.)
I will add this point as a FIXME in the new draft man page.

??? But the code reads:

        case FUTEX_TRYLOCK_PI:
                return futex_lock_pi(uaddr, flags, 0, timeout, 1);
 
which momentarily misleads one into thinking that 'timeout' is used.
And: it's not quite ignored, since in futex_lock_pi() a non-NULL
'timeout' is unconditionally dereferenced (meaning you could get
an EFAULT error for a bad 'timeout' pointer).
I'm confused....

Maybe the above code should be

        case FUTEX_TRYLOCK_PI:
                return futex_lock_pi(uaddr, flags, 0, NULL, 1);
?

Added, but with the same text as for FUTEX_LOCK_PI above. I.e., the text
"Thats either state corruption or it found a waiter on uaddr which is
waiting on FUTEX_WAIT[_BITSET]" is also included.

The above seems not to be correct. I've written the discussion of
'timeout' up as I understand it, and added a FIXME to the draft page.

Added using the same text as FUTEX_WAIT:

       EAGAIN (FUTEX_WAIT, FUTEX_WAIT_REQUEUE_PI) The value pointed to
              by  uaddr was not equal to the expected value val at the
              time of the call.
