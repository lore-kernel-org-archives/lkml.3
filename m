From: Michael Neuling <mikey@neuling.org>

commit ec67ad82814bee92251fd963bf01c7a173856555 upstream.

In a recent patch:
  commit c13f20ac48328b05cd3b8c19e31ed6c132b44b42
  Author: Michael Neuling <mikey@neuling.org>
  powerpc/signals: Mark VSX not saved with small contexts

We fixed an issue but an improved solution was later discussed after the patch
was merged.

Firstly, this patch doesn't handle the 64bit signals case, which could also hit
this issue (but has never been reported).

Secondly, the original patch isn't clear what MSR VSX should be set to.  The
new approach below always clears the MSR VSX bit (to indicate no VSX is in the
context) and sets it only in the specific case where VSX is available (ie. when
VSX has been used and the signal context passed has space to provide the
state).

This reverts the original patch and replaces it with the improved solution.  It
also adds a 64 bit version.
