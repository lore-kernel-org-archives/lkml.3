OK, here it is, hopefully with sufficient comments:
    
blkdev_read_iter() wants to cap the iov_iter by the amount of
data remaining to the end of device.  That's what iov_iter_truncate()
is for (trim iter->count if it's above the given limit).  So far,
so good, but the argument of iov_iter_truncate() is size_t, so on
32bit boxen (in case of a large device) we end up with that upper
limit truncated down to 32 bits *before* comparing it with iter->count.

Easily fixed by making iov_iter_truncate() take 64bit argument -
it does the right thing after such change (we only reach the
assignment in there when the current value of iter->count is greater
than the limit, i.e. for anything that would get truncated we don't
reach the assignment at all) and that argument is not the new
value of iter->count - it's an upper limit for such.

The overhead of passing u64 is not an issue - the thing is inlined,
so callers passing size_t won't pay any penalty.
