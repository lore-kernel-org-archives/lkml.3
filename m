Indeed. That's why i give-up rotated disks and run xfstest only on SSD
or brd module

Amazing idea. Something like:

#dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/fs.img bs=1M seek=2000000 count=1
#mkfs.ext4 -m0 -i4096000 /tmp/fs.img
#mount /tmp/fs.img /mnt/ -oloop
#for ((i=0; i < 2000; i++));do   fallocate -l $((1024*1024*1024)) /mnt/f$i ;done
#for ((i=0; i < 2000; i++));do   truncate -s $((1023*1024*1024)) /mnt/f$i ;done

As result file system image has 2gb of free space wich is fragmented to ~2000
chunks 1Mb each. But image itself is quite small
# df /mnt
Filesystem      1K-blocks       Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/loop0     2047678076 2045679228   1998848 100% /mnt
# du -sch /tmp/fs.img 
242M     /tmp/fs.img
242M     total

Later we can simply run xfstest/fio/fsx on this image.
I'll prepare new xfstest based on that idea. But the only disadvantage
is that loop dev has bottleneck, all requests will be serialized on i_mutex.
