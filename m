systemd is certainly not monolithic for almost any definition of that 
term. I am not sure where you are taking that from, and I am not sure I 
want to discuss on that level. This just sounds like FUD you picked up 
somewhere and are repeating carelessly...

You know, getting this all right isn't easy. If you want to do things 
properly, then you need to propagate attribute changes between the units 
you manage. You also need something like a scheduler, since a number of 
controllers can only be configured under certain external conditions 
(for example: the blkio or devices controller use major/minor parameters 
for configuring per-device limits. Since major/minor assignments are 
pretty much unpredictable these days -- and users probably want to 
configure things with friendly and stable /dev/disk/by-id/* symlinks 
anyway -- this requires us to wait for devices to show up before we can 
configure the parameters.) Soo... you need a graph of units, where you 
can propagate things, and schedule things based on some execution/event 
queue. And the propagation and scheduling are closely intermingled.

Now, that's pretty much exactly what systemd actually *is*. It 
implements a graph of units with a scheduler. And if you rip that part 
out of systemd to make this an "easy cgroup management library", then 
you simply turn what systemd is into a library without leaving anything. 
Which is just bogus.

So no, if you say "seems pretty easy to make this cgroup management a 
library" then well, I have to disagree with you.

Oh, certainly it is. If we'd split up the cgroup fs access into 
separate daemon of some kind, then we'd need some kind of IPC for that, 
and so you have more daemons and you have some complex IPC between the 
processes. So yeah, the systemd approach is certainly both simpler and 
uses fewer daemons then your hypothetical one.

Well, systemd is pretty real, and the code to do the unified cgroup 
management within systemd is pretty complete. systemd is certainly not 
hypothetical.

Oh, my. I am not sure what makes you think it is monolithic.

I have no interest to reimplement systemd as a library, just to make you 
happy... I am quite happy with what we already have....

It certainly sounds *very* differently in what you are writing.
