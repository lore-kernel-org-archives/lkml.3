CCed to Jörn Engel.

I feel the same regarding the many locks. After reviewing patches I
wrote these days, I suppose the version 2
(https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/6/17/319) may worth a re-consideration somehow.
The purpose of or_sem is to mutex co-incident open and allow only one
thread to be processing since it completes checking condition to really
linking a new sfd into sfd_siblings list. My v2 re-implement a sem using
sfd_lock and toopen. But as Jörn pointed out in the following mail, what
I implemented is a rw_sem and that is weird and made him "having trouble
wrapping my head around the semantics of this variable"...
With wait_event involved, it's indeed no sense to use a rw_sem here.
However, if we restrict toopen in [0, 1], not [0, INT_MAX] as I did in
v2, it will act in the same way as or_sem does. Beside the same affect
as or_sem, this implement avoids the problem using in interrupt context
and more readable for me, rather than twisting my head among many
spinlocks and semaphores.
Although v2 seems attractive to me, things would be more complicated
when detached comes in...

The following is a thought I presented previously:
Is it possible to split the sg_add_sfp() into two
functions, sg_init_sfp() and sg_add_sfp2(). We can do all initialize
work in sg_init_sfp()
without any lock and let sg_add_sfp2() only serve lock-check-add in one
place. It is less flaky.

Douglas,
What Christoph points out is a sanity check for the input parameter
flags, not the scsi_block_when_processing_errors issue.
I guess you misread that:)
