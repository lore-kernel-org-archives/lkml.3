You could bypass O_DIRECT and use ddpt together with
a bsg pass-through (bsg is a little faster than sg
for these purposes).

For example:

# lsscsi -g
[0:0:0:0]    disk    ATA    INTEL SSDSC2CW12 400i  /dev/sda /dev/sg0
[14:0:0:0]   disk    Linux  scsi_debug       0004  -        /dev/sg1

# ddpt if=/dev/bsg/14:0:0:0 bs=512 bpt=128 count=1m
Output file not specified so no copy, just reading input
1048576+0 records in
0+0 records out
time to read data: 0.283566 secs at 1893.28 MB/sec

bs= should match the block size of the storage device and
the size of each SCSI READ is dictated by bpt= (so 64 KB
in this case).

Such a test should show you if your performance problem
is in the block layer or below, or above the block layer
(at least the point where pass-through commands are
injected).
