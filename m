Would that be a problem in this particular case?  Has it been measured?

I don't object to adding rwsem_is_contended() *if* it is required.  I 
was just pointing out that there may be other options.

The patch adds a bunch of new semantics to rwsem.  There is a trade off 
between increased complexity of core code, and generalizing subsystem 
specific optimizations that may not be globally useful.

Is it worth it in this case?  I do not know.
