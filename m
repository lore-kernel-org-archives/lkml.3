I mean wbc->nr_to_write may still be positive when mpage_prepare_extent_to_map()
returns zero, so your change will cause ext4_writepages not to break from the
loop, then write hangs, too crazy?

Your understanding is right, and I think it is a correct fix, because
we shouldn't add more pages to extent than nr_to_write.

Looks it makes sense, so how about below change?
