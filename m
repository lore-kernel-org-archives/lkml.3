Don't we check the bitmaps upon load to verify they are not bogus?
Looks like this is disabled completely if flex_bg is enabled, though
I guess that it is not impossible to do some checking even if flex_bg
is enabled.

For example, we have the background thread to do the inode table =
zeroing,
and it could load the block bitmaps and check the group descriptors for
itable and bitmap locations against the various bitmaps.  With flex_bg,
this would probably only load a small subset of block bitmaps.

Even without remount-ro, it would be possible to flag the block bitmaps
for a particular group as corrupt, so that no new allocations are done
from that group until the next e2fsck is run.
