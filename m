  With this, you have essentially reverted a hunk from commit 
8e3dffc651cb668e1ff4d8b89cc1c3dde7540d3b. But I don't see a reason why it
should be reverted. num should never ever be greater than *count and when
num == count, we the code inside if doesn't do anything useful.

I've looked into the code and I think I see the problem. It is a long
standing bug in __ext2_get_block() in fs/ext2/xip.c. It calls
ext2_get_block() asking for 0 blocks to map (while we really want 1 block).
ext2_get_block() just passes that request and ext2_get_blocks() actually
allocates 1 block. And that's were the commit you have identified makes a
difference because previously we returned that 1 block was allocated while
now we return that 0 blocks were allocated and thus allocation is repeated
until all free blocks are exhaused.

Attached patch should fix the problem.

Subject: [PATCH] ext2: Fix fs corruption in ext2_get_xip_mem()

Commit 8e3dffc651cb "Ext2: mark inode dirty after the function
dquot_free_block_nodirty is called" unveiled a bug in __ext2_get_block()
called from ext2_get_xip_mem(). That function called ext2_get_block()
mistakenly asking it to map 0 blocks while 1 was intended. Before the
above mentioned commit things worked out fine by luck but after that commit
we started returning that we allocated 0 blocks while we in fact
allocated 1 block and thus allocation was looping until all blocks in
the filesystem were exhausted.

Fix the problem by properly asking for one block and also add assertion
in ext2_get_blocks() to catch similar problems.
