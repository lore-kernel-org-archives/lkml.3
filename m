That is a light summary. As Andrew tends to reject patches with poor
documentation in case we forget the details in 6 months, I'm going to guess
that he does not remember the details of a discussion from 7ish years ago.
This is where Andrew swoops in with a dazzling display of his eidetic
memory just to prove me wrong.

Ric, are there any storage vendor that is pushing for this right now?
Is someone working on this right now or planning to? If they are, have they
looked into the history of fsblock (Nick) and large block support (Christoph)
to see if they are candidates for forward porting or reimplementation?
I ask because without that person there is a risk that the discussion
will go as follows

Topic leader: Does anyone have an objection to supporting larger block
	sizes than the page size?
Room: Send patches and we'll talk.
