Yeah, I'm not sure why it is working on 3.15 x86_64 but not in 3.10 x86_64.
Perhaps it's related to this patch: https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/9/19/349

Oh, I see!

Why didn't you just apply the patch on top of your tree so that the
information included in the git commit (e.g: my name and mail) remains?

This part:

cpuset: quiesce: change irq disable/enable by irq save/restore

The function __migrate_timers can be called under interrupt context
or thread context depending on the core where the system call was
executed. In case it executes under interrupt context, it
seems a bad idea to leave interrupts enabled after migrating the
timers. In fact, this caused kernel errors on the ARM architecture and
on the x86_64 architecture with the 3.10 kernel (backported version
of the cpuset-quiesce patch).
