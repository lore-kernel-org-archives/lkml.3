The problem with the existing encoding is that pre-1970 dates are
encoded with extra bits 1,1 in 64-bit kernels with ext4, but on 32-bit
kernels and inodes that were originally written as ext3 the extra bits
will be 0,0.  Currently, both are decoded as pre-1970 dates.

With your patch, only the 1,1 format used by 64-bit ext4 will decode
as a pre-1970 date.  Dates previously written by ext3 or a 32-bit
kernel will no longer be decoded as expected.  Also the patch does
not update ext4_encode_extra_time to use this format for pre-1970
dates in 32-bit mode.

Possible solutions were discussed here, but no decision was made:
