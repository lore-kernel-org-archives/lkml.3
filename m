Hmmm,
Feb  8 01:39:16 server01 kernel: [ 1757.266678] Memory cgroup out of memory: Kill process 18211 (apache2) score 725 or sacrifice child)

So the process has been killed 10 minutes ago and this was really the
last OOM event for group /1258:

$ grep "Task in /1258/uid killed" kern2.log | tail -n2
Feb  8 01:39:16 server01 kernel: [ 1757.045021] Task in /1258/uid killed as a result of limit of /1258
Feb  8 01:39:16 server01 kernel: [ 1757.167984] Task in /1258/uid killed as a result of limit of /1258

But this was still before you started collecting data for memcg-bug-4
(2:34) so we do not know what was the previous stack unfortunatelly.

Are you sure about that? When I extracted all pids from timestamp
directories and greped them in the log I got this:
for i in `cat bug/pids` ; do grep "\[ *\<$i\>\]" kern2.log ; done

So at least 7888, 8011 and 8102 were from a different group (1293).
Others were never listed in the eligible processes list which is a bit
unexpected. It is also unfortunate because I cannot match them to their
groups from the log.
$ for i in `cat bug/pids` ; do grep "\[ *\<$i\>\]" kern2.log >/dev/null || echo "$i not listed" ; done
7265 not listed
7474 not listed
7710 not listed

Are you sure all of them belong to 1258 group?

You are right, almost all of them are waiting in mem_cgroup_handle_oom
which suggest that they should be listed in a per group eligible tasks
list.

One way how this might happen is when a process which manages to
get oom_lock has a fatal signal pending. Then we wouldn't get to
oom_kill_process and no OOM messages would get printed. This is correct
because such a task would terminate soon anyway and all the waiters
would wake up eventually. If not enough memory would be freed another
task would get the oom_lock and this one would trigger OOM (unless it
has fatal signal pending as well).

Another option would be that no task could be selected - e.g. because
select_bad_process sees TIF_MEMDIE marked task - the one already killed
by OOM killer but that wasn't able to terminate for some reason. 18211
could be such a task. But we do not know what was going on with it
before strace attached to it.

Finally it is possible that the OOM header (everything up to Kill process)
was suppressed because of rate limiting. But
$ grep -B1 "Kill process" kern2.log

says that the message was preceded by a process list so we can exclude
rate limiting.

I would bet that there is something weird going on with pid:18211. But I
do not have enough information to find out what and why.

As already mentioned above, select_bad_process doesn't select any task
if there is one which is on the way out. Maybe this is what is going on here.

0xffffffffffffffff is just a bogus entry. No idea why this happens.

Yes, this is perfectly ok, because that task starts with:
$ cat bug/1360287245/7710/stack
[<ffffffff81125eb9>] poll_schedule_timeout+0x49/0x70
[<ffffffff8112675b>] do_sys_poll+0x54b/0x680
[<ffffffff81126b4c>] sys_poll+0x7c/0xf0
[<ffffffff815b6866>] system_call_fastpath+0x18/0x1d
[<ffffffffffffffff>] 0xffffffffffffffff

and then later on it gets into OOM because of a page fault:
$ cat bug/1360287250/7710/stack
[<ffffffff8110ae51>] mem_cgroup_handle_oom+0x241/0x3b0
[<ffffffff8110ba83>] T.1149+0x5f3/0x600
[<ffffffff8110bf5c>] mem_cgroup_charge_common+0x6c/0xb0
[<ffffffff8110bfe5>] mem_cgroup_newpage_charge+0x45/0x50
[<ffffffff810eca1e>] do_wp_page+0x14e/0x800
[<ffffffff810edf04>] handle_pte_fault+0x264/0x940
[<ffffffff810ee718>] handle_mm_fault+0x138/0x260
[<ffffffff810270bd>] do_page_fault+0x13d/0x460
[<ffffffff815b633f>] page_fault+0x1f/0x30
[<ffffffffffffffff>] 0xffffffffffffffff

And it loops in it until the end which is possible as well if the group
is under permanent OOM condition and the task is not selected to be
killed.

Unfortunately I am not able to reproduce this behavior even if I try
to hammer OOM like mad so I am afraid I cannot help you much without
further debugging patches.
I do realize that experimenting in your environment is a problem but I
do not many options left. Please do not use strace and rather collect
/proc/pid/stack instead. It would be also helpful to get group/tasks
file to have a full list of tasks in the group
