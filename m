Hello Jeff

Thank you for your comments. Please see inline.

We shared a support for the low-level cancellation method some time ago. 
Please look for a patch from Konstantin Dorfman from June 30 subjected:
[RFC/PATCH v2] mmc: Add support to handle Urgent data transfer
This patch set was released as a usage example for the mmc patch. They 
should go together actually in order to achieve the benefit described 
bellow.

This is not related to my patch. Have no idea how it got in. I'll upload 
a new version soon. Sorry about that.

You're right, our main concern are long-running writes. Preempting lower 
priority read request won't give us much benefit because read requests 
are usually short.
In the current implementation of urgent request in the mmc driver, short 
requests or reads won't be preempted. The block layer notifies the 
device driver of an urgent pending but it's the device driver decision 
whether to stop an ongoing request or not.
CFQ doesn't distinguish between read and sync write. And we do want to 
preempt sync write requests.
