The file status flags are far too coarse -- for example, O_RDONLY
doesn't prevent fchmod(2).

Also, because they're associated with the struct file there is no way
to pass a file descriptor with only a subset of rights across a UNIX
socket (how do I send a read-only FD corresponding to my
O_RDWR file?).

True, the ability to pass FDs across UNIX sockets is one of the
key things that makes them analogous to object-capabilities and
suitable as the substratum for Capsicum.  But the coarseness of the
existing rights, and the lack of coherent policing of those rights,
means that an (opt-in) extension like Capsicum is useful.

Yeah, revocation is interesting.  There was been some discussion of
it for Capsicum a while ago:
https://lists.cam.ac.uk/pipermail/cl-capsicum-discuss/2011-January/msg00002.html
but I don't think a firm conclusion was reached.  As I understand it,
there's also a theoretical argument that revocation can be constructed
on top of the capability system, by handing out capabilities to proxy
objects that can then change their behaviour so they no longer pass
operations through.

See above.

A simple example is something like unzip/tar -xf, where locking it down
is conceptually as simple as:
 - apply a CAP_READ restriction to the FD for the input file
 - apply a CAP_WRITE+CAP_LOOKUP restriction to the DFD for the
   output directory
 - enter capability mode.
Then the worst a malicious input file can do is to write files under the
output directory -- which it could do anyway.

Similarly, migrating an application that writes temporary files out to
some tempdir is much more straightforward if openat(dfd,...) is still
allowed.

The set of syscalls allowed in capability mode is based more on the
principle of restricting access to global namespaces, to prevent (in
particular) the confused deputy problem.  Allowing kill(self) is a pragmatic
compromise to make it easier to migrate existing applications to use
Capsicum.

seL4 may have a much simpler (and more formally-correct) model, but
the aim of Capsicum is to get some of the benefits of that well-analysed
model without the need for a (massive) migration effort -- and in a way
that allows co-existence of migrated and unmigrated code.

I think that's a lot harder for application writers to do -- they would need
to have CAP_SYS_ADMIN to set up the namespace & mounts before
dropping privileges.  And the net result would again be much less
fine-grained (e.g. for the unzip example above, the specific capability
rights prevent reading of any files that already exist in the output
directory).
