Hi Doug,

Thanks for providing advice on how to fix this.
However, it seems be still awkward somehow. We have to
1. hold a lock (maybe sg_index_lock or a new one)
2. check
   a) the new three-state field;
   b) if sfp list is empty;
   c) sdp->detached field;
if either condition fails, we may link the open process into o_excl_wait
queue and need wakeup.
if satisfied, we go on.
3. then we release at least sg_index_lock to malloc a new sfp and
initialize.
4. try to acquire sg_index_lock again and add this sfp into sfd_siblings
list if possible.  <== We still have to check at least sdp->detached field
5. update three-state field to reflect the result of Step 4, and wake up
processes waiting in o_excl_wait.

This uncomfortable is introduced by releasing the sg_index_lock in the
middle of check->malloc->add the new sfp struct.

I wanna ask if it is possible to split the sg_add_sfp() into two
functions, sg_init_sfp() and sg_add_sfp2(). We can do all initialize
work in sg_init_sfp()
without any lock and let sg_add_sfp2() only serve lock-check-add in one
way. It seems more convenient for me to understand.
But there is still some questions on this approach:
1. memory consume can be very large if lots of sg_init_sfp in the same time;
2. some field are initialized according to the fields of scsi device sdp
points to, such as low_dma, sg_tablesize, max_sector, phys_segs.
    I know scsi_device_get() would keep the underlying scsi_device
alive, however would these fields change in the gap of our initialize
and add?
    The relationship of sg_device and scsi_device like above said
confuse me somehow...

Thanks,
Vaughan
