Heh, that would have followed right after where you cut the quote:
with CONFIG_SLUB, that pointer actually sits in already existing
struct page padding, which means that I'm saving one pointer per page
(8 bytes per 4096 byte page, 0.19% of memory), plus the pointer and
padding in each memory section.  I also save the (minor) translation
overhead going from page to page_cgroup and the maintenance burden
that stems from having these auxiliary arrays (see deleted code).
