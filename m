Fair enough, that makes sense -- I've now got a version of the selftest
running within xfstests (git://oss.sgi.com/xfs/cmds/xfstests.git is the
master repo, right?).

Given that xfstests is independent of the kernel, what's the expected
way to deal with flags (or syscalls) that are only in specific kernel
versions?   At the moment I've just got a primitive override at
compile time (#ifndef O_BENEATH #define O_BENEATH ...), and
then the test will fail at run-time against an older kernel -- is there a
need for anything more sophisticated?  (And if so, are there any
examples I can crib from?)

Also, is there an archive of the fstests@ mailing list somewhere?

Thanks,
David
