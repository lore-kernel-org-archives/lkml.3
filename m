It's important to distinguish between the blocked_list/hash and the
file_lock_list. Yes, they use the same embedded list_head or hlist_node
in the file_lock, but they have very different characteristics and use
cases.

In the testing I did, having a hashtable for the blocked locks helped a
lot more than a percpu list. The trick with deadlock detection is to
ensure that you don't spend a lot of time walking the lists. Since we
do deadlock detection frequently, we need to optimize for that case.

For the file_lock_list, it might make sense to have percpu hlists with
an lglock however. The thing to note here is that the file_lock_list is
almost never read. Only /proc/locks uses it, so anything we can do to
optimize the list manipulation is probably worth it.

All that said, I'm leery about changing too much of this code too fast.
It's pretty old and poorly understood, so I think we need to be
cautious and take an incremental approach to changing it.
