Hi Will,

I do plan on looking at this more very soon, but since it’s v2 only and just warning
(and not crashing anything) it didn’t jump to the top of my list. It is only printing the
warnings, right? That’s no reason to switch things up ;)

It might be interesting to get some rpcdebug output around the time of the warning,
but I’m not sure it will be useful.

Since I cannot reproduce this, my next step is to inspect the code with an NFSv2
with 64k pages setup in mind.
