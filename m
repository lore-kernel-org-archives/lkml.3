I'm afraid that will break seccomp or will make it much more
complicated.
Also I think syscall latency with the latest improvements is
actually quite fast, so chaining of syscalls is probably an overkill.
Same goes to Andy's argument of doing immediate CTL_MOD.
Let user space do it. It makes sense to combine things only
when atomicity is needed. Here it's not the case.
