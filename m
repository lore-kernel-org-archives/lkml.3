This isn't the case for XFS. I typically see 1TB scratch devices
only being ~10-20% slower than 10GB scratch devices, and 10TB only
being a little slower than 1TB scratch devices. I have to use sparse
devices and --large-fs for 100TB filesystem testing, so I can't
directly compare the speeds to those that I run on physical devices.
However I can say that it isn't significantly slower than using
small scratch devices...

That's exactly what the --large-fs patch set I posted months ago does
for ext4 - it uses fallocate() to fill all but 50GB of the large
filesystem without actually writing any data and runs the standard
tests in the remaining unused space.

However, last time I tested ext4 with this patchset (when I posted
the patches months ago), multi-TB preallocation on ext4 was still too
slow to make it practical for testing on devices larger than 2-3TB.
Perhaps it would make testing 1-2TB ext4 filesystems fast enough
that you could do it regularly...

Cheers,

Dave.
