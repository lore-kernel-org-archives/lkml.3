Sure. That's kind of what I was thinking to make it easy to test and
have widespread support up front.

Toss anything that is hard back to the page cache path. Overlapping
blocks, partial blocks and so can be handled by the slow path
without making the offload path complex.

Make the offload do the simple stuff fast - the mapping and
completion callbacks should be no different to the direct IO bits we
have now, and if you only handle filesystem block aligned ranges in
the offload (rather than sector alignment) most of the grot that DIO
code has to handle goes away....

Cheers,

Dave.
