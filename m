I agree that we should return an error, but hadn't considered what
error. Given that hardly any NFS clients use them, I'd probably just go
with NFS4ERR_SERVERFAULT, and maybe throw a printk or something on the
server about enabling share reservations for superblock x:y.

Pavel, as a side note, you may want to consider adding a patch to hook
this stuff up in the NFS client as well.
