When a loop-back NFS mount is active and the backing device for the
NFS mount becomes congested, that can impose throttling delays on the
nfsd threads.

These delays significantly reduce throughput and so the NFS mount
remains congested.

This results in a live lock and the reduced throughput persists.

This live lock has been found in testing with the 'wait_iff_congested'
call, and could possibly be caused by the 'congestion_wait' call.

This livelock is similar to the deadlock which justified the
introduction of PF_LESS_THROTTLE, and the same flag can be used to
remove this livelock.

To minimise the impact of the change, we still throttle nfsd when the
filesystem it is writing to is congested, but not when some separate
filesystem (e.g. the NFS filesystem) is congested.
