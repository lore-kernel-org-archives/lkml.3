Mmmmmm.

The call to blk_queue_bounce() exists within blk_mq_make_request(), but
AFAICT this should still be getting invoked regardless of if the struct
request is dispatched into blk-mq via the modified blk_execute_rq() ->
blk_execute_rq_nowait() -> blk_mq_insert_request() codepath, or directly
via blk_mq_execute_rq()..

Most certainly.  ;)

AFAICT, getting an initial conversion of libata up does not depend upon
this specific issue being addressed first.  I could be wrong however..

Sure.  I should have a few extra cycles to hack on this over the
weekend.

Also, thinking about this some more, trying to convert ahci to scsi-mq
first (using QEMU emulation), while keeping a rootfs on PIIX_IDE might
make debugging slightly easier..
