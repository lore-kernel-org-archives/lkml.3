Even with little sleep I know what I have written.
YES, it didn't fix my problem but it also did not hurt my system.
I just run Linux Test Project w/o errors which also means nothing.
( Hmmm, I checked-out xfstests... did I compile it :-)? )

I am not following the linux-ext4/linux-fsdevel MLs so much, but IIRC
this patch is from December 2012.
An identical patch for JBD (approx. from same date) went upstream,
that's why I asked.
But now I know you care of JBD2 stuff :-).
Of course, I leave it to the experts to decide.
Come on Eric, open the pandora box and bomb Ted with logs and traces :-).

A good attitude - a man we can trust!

I would liked to see a more positive development on my issue.
But I still see no real reason to throw this WUBI installation away
hitting a "corner" case.
It was done as a temporary installation and made me happy in my daily
working life.
If I will get unhappy I boot into Win7, oops.
