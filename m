In my plan, first save msi_chip in pci_sys_data, so we could remove the lots duplicate
pcibios_add_bus(), second, make a generic pci_host_bridge, and move the msi_chip in that,
so we could eliminate all MSI arch weak functions. And in arm I think it's no need to
associate msi_chip with PCI bus, because all pci devices under the same pci host bridge
share the same msi_chip.
