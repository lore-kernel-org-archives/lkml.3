Please note that I'm not familiar with SAS. But I found this in 
drivers/scsi/scsi_proc.c:

  * proc_scsi_write - handle writes to /proc/scsi/scsi
  * @file: not used
  * @buf: buffer to write
  * @length: length of buf, at most PAGE_SIZE
  * @ppos: not used
  *
  * Description: this provides a legacy mechanism to add or remove
  * devices by Host, Channel, ID, and Lun.  To use,
  * "echo 'scsi add-single-device 0 1 2 3' > /proc/scsi/scsi" or
  * "echo 'scsi remove-single-device 0 1 2 3' > /proc/scsi/scsi" with
  * "0 1 2 3" replaced by the Host, Channel, Id, and Lun.
