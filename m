That's true iif they are cached.

If not then it's a remote DRAM access cache miss for all CPUs except the node that 
holds that memory.

IDT accesses for pure userspace execution are pretty rare. So we are not just 
talking about huge NUMA machines here but about ordinary NUMA machines taking a 
remote cache miss hit for the first IRQ or other IDT-accessing operation they do 
after some cache-intense user-space processing.

It's a small effect, but it exists and improving it would be legitimate.
