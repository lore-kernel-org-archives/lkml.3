The block layer can only describe one contiguous block range in a
request. My copy offload patches introduces the bi_special field that
allows us to attach additional information to an I/O. I have
experimented with doing that for discards to overcome the suck of DSM
TRIM. Splitting and merging requests in MD/DM gets much more cumbersome,
though.

We support merging contiguous smaller discard requests.

We did discuss having a (separate) I/O scheduler to coalesce
discontiguous discard requests. However, the attempts at this turned out
to be pretty hideous.

It also wasn't evident that it was worth the hassle. While UNMAP allows
us to express large regions, DSM TRIM on the SATA side is limited to 32
MB per range. So in many cases we end up maxing out the payload capacity
even with a single contiguous range.

We expect LBP SCSI devices to queue commands. Being able to express
multiple ranges in one shot is less critical in that case.
