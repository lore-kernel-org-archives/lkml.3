I consider it a non-starter.  unpriv users are allowed to launch their
own user namespace.  The whole point of audit is to have only a priv
user be allowed to make changes.  If you tied audit namespace to user
namespace you grant an unpriv user the ability to modify audit.

NAK.

If there are not clone flags you will either need to only do this from
unshare and not from clone, or get more flags to clone
