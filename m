Sure, we could replace the interface with something that matches a more
common pattern.
The wait_queue is chosen based on a hash of the bit and the word, and we
sometimes want "test_and_set_bit", and sometimes "test_bit" but we could
probably come up with reasonable definitions for

   wait_bit{,_lock}{,_interruptible,_killable}{,_io}{,_freezable}{,_timeout=
}(
           bit, word [, timeout]);

there are 48 functions there.  We don't need all of them of course.

My particular use case (as currently designed) wouldn't actually be met by
these.  In the 'action' function I current check to see if the connection
that the NFS client has is to the local machine or a remote machine and
adjust the timeout accordingly (and this state can change while waiting).

So I guess we add a "_cmd" set of interfaces too.

I'm not sure it's worth the effort - can we just stick with my idea?
Maybe defined and export action wrappers for

 io_schedule  schedule schedule(interruptible),=20

that covers everything except a couple of NFS/RPC things which which should
probably stay local to NFS/RPC.
