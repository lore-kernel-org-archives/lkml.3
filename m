struct pci_sys_data is architecture specific, so the code won't become
any more generic than it is now.

I agree, this can be done step by step.

But like I said above, we wouldn't gain anything by moving the MSI chip
into struct pci_sys_data, since the core code couldn't access it from
there. The code wouldn't become more generic than the current approach
of using pcibios_add_bus(). At least for Tegra it's trivial to just hook
it up in tegra_pcie_scan_bus() directly (patch attached). So I think a
generic solution would be to allow it to be easily associated with a
bus.

Perhaps it would be as simple as adding a pci_scan_root_bus_with_msi()
or something with a less awkward name, or extending the existing
pci_scan_root_bus() with an MSI chip parameter. The function already has
too many arguments for my taste, though, so I'd like to avoid the
latter.
