But this is exactly why it was created.

If you do the "= 0" then it is gone forever. If you have missed a legitimate
needed assignment, it will be missed as well.

But if you do the uninitialized_var() dance then there is a make option that turns
it off and every once in a while people do a make with it to see if it still
holds.

The diff between foo = 0; and uninitialized_var(foo) is that the programmer is
communicating to his friends that:
	"I have encountered a bogus compiler, this is falsely initialized"

As opposed to =0 the compiler bug is covered up and forgotten

Right! so that is how you specify this in code at Linux: uninitialized_var(foo);

Putting =0 is way way worse, because it will never be revised and specially
not automatically with a make switch.

And leaving the warning on is even worse because two three of these and people
start to ignore warnings.

uninitialized_var was made to be a friend not an enemy, in the face of real
ugliness it is the best we can do. And that is what it should communicate to
everyone. Why has it become everyone's favorite blasphemy I do not know.
