Actually userspace does not need to be modified. The code to use this 
functionality is already present in database code since this same 
functionality exists on other OSs (the API is a little different but 
those details can be handled with a simple header file in userspace). 
Userspace code has already been tested and debugged thoroughly on the 
OSs that support this functionality and that has significant impact on 
testing effort. So for userspace it is simply a matter of turning that 
code on on Linux as well and recompiling. This would be a multi-platform 
solution for database/java as opposed to a Linux specific solution.
