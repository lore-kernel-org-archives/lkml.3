OK, I'll try that out.

To avoid breaking make and similar tools.  Suppose that an output file
already exists but is stale.  Some program gets called to update it,
and it opens it for write, mmaps it, updates it, calls munmap, and
exits.  Its parent will expect the timestamp to have been updated, but
writeback may not have happened.

Last time I checked, all the paths that actually needed the timestamp
update went through .writepages.  I'll double-check.

Fair enough.  I'll spin a v4 and see how it looks.
