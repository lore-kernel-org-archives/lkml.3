Thanks, I'm clear. The relocation changes addresses assigned to kernel symbols
themselves and kernel text region is loaded into the newly assigned relocated
address. So, phys_base results in 0.

Partially yes. I think OK to analyze crash dump by crash utility, a gdb-based
symbolic debugger for kernel, since phys_base absorbs kernel offset caused by
relocation and phys_base is available in the way I explained above.

However, the gained phys_base is not correct one, exactly
phys_base + offset_by_relocation.
When analyzing crash dump by crash utility, we use debug information generated
during kernel build, which we install as kernel-debuginfo on RHEL for example.
Symbols in debuginfo have statically assigned addresses at build so we see
the statically assigned addresses during debugging and we see
phys_base + offset_by_relocation as phys_base. This would be problematic
if failure on crash dump is relevant to the relocated addresses, though I don't
immediately come up with crash senario where relocated symbol is defitely
necessary.

Still we can get relocated addresses if kallsyms is enabled on the kernel,
but kallsyms and relocatable kernels are authogonal. I don't think it natural
to rely on kallsyms. It seems natural to export relocation information newly
as debugging information.
