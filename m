No, the last conditions refers to adjacent byte stores from different
cpu contexts (either interrupt or SMP).

For a simple test like:

struct x {
	long a;
	char b;
	char c;
	char d;
	char e;
};

void store_bc(struct x *p) {
	p->b = 1;
	p->c = 2;
}

on parisc, gcc generates separate byte stores

void store_bc(struct x *p) {
   0:	34 1c 00 02 	ldi 1,ret0
   4:	0f 5c 12 08 	stb ret0,4(r26)
   8:	34 1c 00 04 	ldi 2,ret0
   c:	e8 40 c0 00 	bv r0(rp)
  10:	0f 5c 12 0a 	stb ret0,5(r26)

which appears to confirm that on parisc adjacent byte data
is safe from corruption by concurrent cpu updates; that is,

CPU 0                | CPU 1
                     |
p->b = 1             | p->c = 2
                     |

will result in p->b == 1 && p->c == 2 (assume both values
were 0 before the call to store_bc()).

Regards,
Peter Hurley
