I addressed that in one of my first emails to this thread. I don't
think adding it now is immediately useful, but it will be very nice to
have in a few years when optimizing for kernels from 2014 and earlier
is no longer a priority. I would expect new users of vdso at that time
not to bother with the ELF parsing ugliness and simply to use the
lookup interface. It's not like they'd be losing any functionality on
old kernels, just some performance due to falling back to the syscall.
