To be honest a workload base on /etc/passwd or /etc/group is completely
artificial, in actual usage, if you really have  such access you use
nscd or sssd with their shared memory caches to completely remove most
of the file access.
I have no beef on the rest but repeated access to Nsswitch information
is not something you need to optimize at the file system layer and
should not be brought up as a point in favor.

Simo.
