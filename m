I'm not sure I'm following.  What writeback layer provides is cgroup
awareness when dealing with I_DIRTY_PAGES.  Metadata writebacks will
become automatically cgroup-aware to the extent they go through
regular page dirtying mechanism.  If some don't go through that
channel (e.g. journals shouldn't to avoid priority inversion), it's
upto the specific filesystem to decide how to handle them.  In most
cases, I imagine they'd be sent down as originating from the root
cgroup, ie, as the system cost.  Specific filesystems can be more
sophisticated, I suppose.

Ultimately, the only thing which matters is with which cgroup a bio is
associated when issued.  What's implemented in this patchset is
propagation of memcg tags for pagecache pages.  If necessary, further
mechanisms can be added, but this should cover the basics.

Would such a filesystem take over writeback mechanism too?  The
implemented mechanism is fairly modular and the counterparts in each
filesystem should be able to use them the same way the core writeback
code does.  I'm afraid I can't say much without knowing further
details.

I measured avg sys+user time of 50 iterations of

  fs_mark -d /mnt/tmp/ -s 104857600 -n 32

on an ext2 on a ramdisk, which should put the hot path part - page
faulting and inode dirtying - under spotlight.  cgroup writeback
enabled but not used case consumes around 1% more cpu time - AVG 6.616
STDEV 0.050 w/o this patchset, AVG 6.682 STDEV 0.046 with.  This is an
extreme case and while it isn't free the overhead is fairly low.

I don't think that's a good idea.  Implementing that isn't hard.
Range writeback can simply avoid skipping pages from different
cgroups; however, different cgroups can have vastly different
characteristics.  One may be configured to have a majority of the
available bandwidth while another has to scrap by with few hundreds of
k's per sec.  Initiating write out on pages which belong to the former
from the writeback of the latter may cause serious priority inversion
issues.

Maybe we can think of optimizations down the road but I'd strongly
prefer to stick to simple and clear divisions among cgroups.  Also, a
file highly interleaved by multiple cgroups isn't a particularly
likely use case.

This was in the head message, but, to repeat, two more pointers if
!CONFIG_IMA, which is the case for fedora at least.  If CONFIG_IMA is
enabled, it becomes three pointers.  In my test setup, before the
patchset or CONFIG_CGROUP_WRITEBACK disabled, it's 544 bytes and w/
CONFIG_CGROUP_WRITEBACK 560.

Thanks.
