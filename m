So while that gets sorted out, would it be safe to just do as Geert
did on m68k and put:

#define __put_user_unaligned(x, ptr) __put_user((x), (ptr))

in arch/arm/include/asm/uaccess.h, and let the normal accessors and
kernel-side trapping deal with things?  I'm thinking that's a local
fix until something gets sorted upstream, but I don't want to do it if
it's going to break things.
