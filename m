It's worth noting that:

 - Proper credential passing could be added to UNIX sockets, and we
may want to do that anyway.  Also, the current kdbus semantics seem to
be "spew lots of credentials and other miscellaneous
potentially-sensitive and sometime spoofable information all over the
place", which isn't obviously an improvement.  (This is fixable, but
it will almost certainly not be compatible with current systemd kdbus
code if fixed.)

 - The current kdbus patches seem to be worse than UNIX sockets from a
namespace perspective, but maybe I'm misunderstanding how it's
supposed to work.  UNIX sockets work quite nicely in containers.

 - There's an obvious interface to add timestamping to UNIX sockets
(it could work exactly the way it does for UDP / PTP).

 - I'm unconvinced by this performance argument without numbers.  The
kdbus credential code, at least, looks to be quite heavy on allocation
and atomics.  This isn't to say that the current userspace D-Bus
daemon doesn't also serialize everything, but it could be made
multithreaded.

 - Race-free?  What are the races that are inherent to UNIX sockets?
