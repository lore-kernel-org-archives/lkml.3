No mount options, please. The ACL configuration needs to be
determined solely by the superblock feature bit - we cannot support
filesystems with mixed ACL types, and that's what this mount option
does.

Where are the tests? We need comprehensive coverage in xfstests so
we can validate that it works the way it is supposed to and that we
don't break it in future, and that all filesystems behave the same
way....
