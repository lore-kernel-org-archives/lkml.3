Hello,

Thank you for looking into this. I could reproduce the oops on some
Dell Poweredge R720 with the following config flags, otherwise the
problem goes un-noticed:

CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB=y

[    4.924033] BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffff88000004dd10
[    4.931823] IP: [<ffffffff8139797f>] __scsi_scan_target+0x3ef/0x6f0
[    4.938846] PGD 1ba1067 PUD 1ba2067 PMD 1ba3067 PTE 800000000004d060
[    4.945985] Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP DEBUG_PAGEALLOC
[    4.951074] Modules linked in:
[    4.954492] CPU: 0 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted 3.12.0-smp-scsi01 #1

This points to this line on the return path of scsi_report_lun_scan:
if (scsi_device_created(sdev))

Kernel is jejb/scsi/for-next at 2aee240c68ed32 and I could reproduce
the bug with other 3.x kernels on same hardware. For me, it is 100%
reproducible.

The ref counter values I indicated in my previous email are the result
of a basic instrumentation. It shows that ref count drops from 3 to 1
as a result of scsi_probe_and_add_lun(). I believe this is because the
latter calls __scsi_remove_device(sdev).

Now, if sdev reclaiming is not allowed to happen at the end of
scsi_report_lun_scan by design because someone else is expected to
hold a reference to it, then I'd be happy to add a BUG_ON() on the
return path and explicit the post-condition in the function
documentation, and also try to find out where a ref is killed by
mistake. However, if sdev relcaiming at the end of
scsi_report_lun_scan is allowed, then I'd argue that the "if
(scsi_device_created(sdev))" on the potentially reclaimed sdev is not
right, that's why I was proposing this patch.

Regards,
