Not concpetually, but create_kthread() uses CLONE_FS, and I don't
think it's just umask that things like nfsd want to avoid sharing.
What about all the *other* fields?

Just as an example: even if all the threads actually end up all having
the same global root, what about contention on 'fs->lock'?

I have *not* looked at the details, and maybe there's some reason I'm
completely off, but it worries me.
