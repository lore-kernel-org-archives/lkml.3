I don't get it -- why is it bad to hold a lock across a freeze event?

The problem that we have is that we must often hold locks across
long-running syscalls (consider something like sync()). In the event
that there is a lot of dirty data, it might take a long time for that
to finish.

There's also the problem that it's not uncommon for the freezer to take
down userland processes (such as NetworkManager) which in turn take
down network interfaces that we need to talk to the server.

The fix from a couple of years ago (which admittedly needs more work)
was to allow the freezing of tasks that are waiting on a reply from the
server. That sort of necessitates that we are allowed to hold our locks
across the try_to_freeze call though.

If that's no longer allowed then we're back to square one with laptops
that fail to suspend when they have NFS mounts. Is there some other
solution we should pursue instead?
