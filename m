It seems that we do not understand each other.

I do not like this hack too. And it is even wrong, you can't really block
SIGKILL. And it is unnecessary in a sense that (I think) it is fine that
module_init() reacts to SIGKILL and aborts, just the fact it crashes the
kernel in the error paths is not fine.

The driver should be fixed anyway. As for timeout, either userspace/systemd
should be changed to not send SIGKILL after 30 secs, or (better) the driver
should be changed to not waste 30 secs.

The hack I sent can only serve as a short term solution, it should be
reverted once we have something better. And, otoh, this hack only affects
the problematic driver which should be fixed in any case.

Do you see my point? I can be wrong, but I think that you constantly
misunderstand the intent.

And now I do not understand you too. I do not understand why should we
"fix" kthread_create().

Personally I do not really think so, but OK. In this case lets revert
786235ee.

And I still think that 786235ee simply uncovered the problems in this
driver. Perhaps we should change kthread_create() for some reason, but
(imho) not because we need to help the buggy code.

Personally I dislike this change. In fact I think it is ugly. But this
is only my opinion.

If you convince someone to take this patch I won't argue.
