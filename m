Hi Tejun,

I thought in workman, "partition" configuration was still centralized
while individual "consumer" configuration was with consumer manger 
(systemd, libvirt, .. etc). IOW, library can tell consumer manger to
which partition to associate consumer with at startup time. (consumer
manager can assume their own defaults if nothing has been told).

Agreed, that weight is meaningful only if one as full hierarchy view
and then one should be able to calculate effective % share of resoures
of a group.

But using the library admin application should be able to query the
full "paritition" hierarchy and their weigths and calculate % system
resources. I think one problem there is cpu controller where % resoruce
of a cgroup depends on tasks entities which are peer to group. But that's
a kernel issue and not user space thing.

So I am not sure what are potential problems with proposed model of
configuration in workman. All the consumer managers still follow what
libarary has told them to do.

I thought any directory under a consumer manger is managed by that
manager and nobody is supposed to dynamically create resource
partition/cgroup there. So that takes away a bit of confusion.

This should be the case as long as we stick to the notion of a manger
managing its own sub-hierarchy.

Two programs ideally would have their own sub hiearchy. And if not one
of the programs should get the conflict when trying to create cgroup and
should back-off or fail or give warning...

> Who owns config knobs in that directory?

IIUC, workman was looking at two types of cgroups. Once called
"partitions" which will be created by library at startup time and
library manages the configuration (something like cgconfig.conf).

And individual managers create their own children groups for various
services under that partition and control the config knobs for those
services.

			user-defined-partition
			     /    |    \
                           virt1  virt2 virt3  

So user should be able to define a partition and control the configuration
using workman lib. And if multiple virtual machines are being run in
the partition, then they create their own cgroups and libvirt controls
the properties of virt1, virt2, virt3 cgroups. I thought that was the
the understanding when we dicussed ownership of config knobs las time.
But things might have changed since last time. Workman folks should
be able to shed light on this.

I thought workman library will provide interfaces so that one can query
and be able to construct the full system view.

Their doc says.

GList *workmanager_partition_get_children(WorkmanPartition *partition,
                                            GError **error);


So I am assuming this can be used to construct the full partition
hierarchy and associated resource allocation.

Right now systemd seems to be giving initial structure. I guess we will
require some changes where systemd itself runs in a cgroup and that
allows one to create peer groups. Something like.
				
				root
				/  \
			   systemd other-groups
	
So currently no central authority is enforcing it. It seems to be just
a matter of right defaults in systemd.

Given the fact that library has view of full system resoruces (both
persistent view and active view), shouldn't we just be able to extend
the API to meet additional configuration or resource needs.
