Thanks. I'll see if I can get some standard deviation numbers here, and
I'll do it on some bare metal to ensure that virtualization doesn't
skew any results.

FWIW, they were all consistently very close to one another when I ran
these tests, and the times were all consistently shorter than the
unpatched kernel.

That said, this test is pretty rough. Doing this with "time" measures
other things that aren't related to locking. So I'll also see if I
can come up with a way to measure the actual locking performance more
accurately too.
