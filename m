Hello,

This patch adds scsi device failfast mode to avoid infinite retry loop.

Currently, scsi error handling in scsi_decide_disposition() and
scsi_io_completion() unconditionally retries on some errors. This is because
retryable errors are thought to be temporary and the scsi device will soon
recover from those errors. Normally, such retry policy is appropriate because
the device will soon recover from temporary error state.
But there is no guarantee that device is able to recover from error state
immediately. Some hardware error may prevent device from recovering.
Therefore hardware error can results in infinite command retry loop. In fact,
CHECK_CONDITION error with the sense-key = UNIT_ATTENTION caused infinite
retry loop in our environment. As the comments in kernel source code says,
UNIT_ATTENTION means the device must have been a power glitch and expected
to immediately recover from the state. But it seems that hardware error
caused permanent UNIT_ATTENTION error.

To solve the above problem, this patch introduces scsi device "failfast mode".
If failfast mode is enabled, retry counts of all scsi commands are limited to
scsi->allowed(== SD_MAX_RETRIES == 5). All commands are prohibited to retry
infinitely, and immediately fails when the retry count exceeds upper limit.
Failfast mode is useful on mission critical systems which are required
to keep running flawlessly because they need to failover to the secondary
system once they detect failures.
On default, failfast mode is disabled because failfast policy is not suitable
for most use cases which can accept I/O latency due to device hardware error.

To enable failfast mode(default disabled):
         # echo 1 > /sys/bus/scsi/devices/X:X:X:X/failfast
To disable:
         # echo 0 > /sys/bus/scsi/devices/X:X:X:X/failfast

Furthermore, I'm planning to make the upper limit count configurable.
Currently, I have two plans to implement it:
(1) set same upper limit count on all errors.
(2) set upper limit count on each error.
The first implementation is simple and easy to implement but not flexible.
Someone wants to set different upper limit count on each errors depends on the
scsi device they use. The second implementation satisfies such requirement
but can be too fine-grained and annoying to configure because scsi error
codes are so much. The default 5 times retry may too much on some errors but
too few on other errors.

Which would be the appropriate implementation?
Any comments or suggestions are welcome as usual.
