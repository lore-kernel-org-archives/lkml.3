Re-issuing a SG_IO ioctl is wrong. More and more SCSI commands (even
in SBC-3) are non-idempotent (e.g. COMPARE AND WRITE). And the st
driver gets to use the block layer as well and many of its important
SCSI commands (SSC) are non-idempotent.

Like to share that fix with us?

Also I'm interested in how you know from within a kernel driver
whether a signal sent to the controlling process is fatal or
not? For example SIGIO's default action is terminate but sg
assumes if the controlling process requests SIGIO generation
then it will at least override that default action and
handle it sensibly. Is there a way to check that assumption?

Looked at bsg in the situation where a signal interrupts a
SG_IO ioctl. It seems broken; anyone like to comment on this
snippet from bsg if a signal hits the first call:
     blk_execute_rq(bd->queue, NULL, rq, at_head);
     ret = blk_complete_sgv4_hdr_rq(rq, &hdr, bio, bidi_bio);
     if (copy_to_user(uarg, &hdr, sizeof(hdr)))
         return -EFAULT;


As an aside, I got tired of handling signals during SCSI commands
in the ddpt utility, especially after adding tape support. So
it now masks all the usual suspects during the IO then checks
for signals in a small window between IOs. Non maskable signals
will still terminate but of course the user gets no guarantees,
but it would be still reasonable in the termination case that
the interrupted SCSI command was _not_ resubmitted.
