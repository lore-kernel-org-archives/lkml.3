oops.. thanks for your reminder!

yes, seems this v6 patchset allows user in un-init user namespace to setup proj quota
through ioctl, and the projid hasn't been converted to kprojid in this patchset.
Doesn't this will cause user in container has the ability to change the proj quota
which is set by root user in host?

I'm ok if we disallow un-init user namespace to setup proj quota right now,
all user namespace will share the same proj quota and only init user namespace
has the rights to modify proj quota. this looks clear to me.
