It's making checkpatch unusable on most drivers because it's spewing
tons of bogus warnings.  The problem is the assumption that studly caps
is always wrong: it isn't if the variables are named after the various
conventions in the hardware programming guides (which are usually
written by Microsoft people).

In order to encourage people to use checkpatch, it has to be *useful* it
can't stray too far into dogmatic things like this that are essentially
unfixable by most people who submit patches.
