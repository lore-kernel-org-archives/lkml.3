Two succeeding with LOCK_EX? AFAIU no. Am I missing something?

I actually checked it and it seemed to work. What problems do
you see with this case?

Well, in our case we parse /proc/locks anyway to see what
files at least to test for being locked. But what you propose
looks even better. I'll look what can be done here.
