Not without memory.oom_reserve_in_bytes that this series adds, that's 
true.  Michal expressed interest in the idea of memcg oom reserves in the 
past, so I thought I'd share the series.

It works reliably with this patch series, yes.  I'm not sure what change 
this is referring to that would avoid memory allocation for userspace oom 
handlers, and I'd agree that it would be difficult to maintain a 
no-allocation policy for a subset of processes that are destined to handle 
oom handlers.

That's not what this series is addressing, though, and in fact it's quite 
the opposite.  It acknowledges that userspace oom handlers need to 
allocate and that anything else would be too difficult to maintain 
(thereby agreeing with the above), so we must set aside memory that they 
are exclusively allowed to access.  For the vast majority of users who 
will not use userspace oom handlers, they can just use the default value 
of memory.oom_reserve_in_bytes == 0 and they incur absolutely no side-
effects as a result of this series.

For those who do use userspace oom handlers, like Google, this allows us 
to set aside memory to allow the userspace oom handlers to kill a process, 
dump the heap, send a signal, drop caches, etc. when waking up.

The rest of this email communicates only one thing: someone thinks it's 
crazy.  And I agree it would be crazy if we don't allow that class of 
process to have access to a pre-defined amount of memory to handle the 
situation, which this series adds.
