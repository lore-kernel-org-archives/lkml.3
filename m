Thanks for the additional clarification.

Is there substantial saved state at the point where the caching thread is
checking need_resched() that precludes dropping and reacquiring the
extent_commit_sem (or before find_next_key())?  Not that it's a cleaner
solution; just want to understand better the situation.
