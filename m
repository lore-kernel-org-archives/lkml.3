If suspend for some reason requires a re-entrant mount, then yes, I can
see how it might be a problem that we're holding a mount-related lock.
The question is why is that necessary?

That code can't be made freezer-friendly if it isn't allowed to hold
basic filesystem-related locks across RPC calls. A number of those RPC
calls do things that need to be protected by VFS or MM-level locks.
i.e.: lookups, file creation/deletion, page fault in/out, ...
 
IOW: the problem would need to be solved differently, possibly by adding
a new FIFREEZE-like call to allow the filesystem to quiesce itself
_before_ NetworkManager pulls the rug out from underneath it. There
would still be plenty of corner cases to keep people entertained (e.g.
the server goes down before the quiesce call is invoked) but at least
the top 90% of cases would be solved.
