At the risk of opening a can of worms, wouldn't this be much more
useful if you could share a pool between multiple connections?

It looks like many (all?) item consumers ignore unknown items.  This
seems like a compatbility problem.

Would it be better to have a bit in each item that toggles between
"ignore me if you don't recognize me" and "error out if you don't
recognize me"?

This thing is a file.  What's wrong with using a normal POSIX mode?
(And what to the read, write, and exec modes do?)

This is still confusing.  There are multiple places in which metadata
is attached.  Which does this apply to?  And why are only creds and
seclabel listed?

What's this for?  I understand the need for the creator of busses to
be authenticated, but doing it like this mean that anyone who will
*fail* authentication can DoS the authentic creator.

I'm confused here.  Is sent data written to the pool when send is
called or when recv is called?

If the former, what prevents DoS, especially DoS due to sending too many fds?

If the latter, where is the data buffered in the mean time?

This makes it sound like fds are installed at receive time.  What
prevents resource exhaustion due to having excessive numbers of fds in
transit (that are presumably not accounted to anyone)?

What does "cancel the message" mean?  Does it just mean that the wait

This does seem illogical.  Does the recipient at least know which

This is weird.  It is also differently illogical than the "illogical"
thing above.

How about restricting access per name and making sure that the
receivers check what name was addressed before taking any action?

Please remove these four items.  They are genuinely useless.  Anything
that uses them for anything is either buggy or should have asked the
sender to put the value in the payload (and immediately wondered why
it was doing that).

Please remove this, too, or justify its use.

This one, too, and please justify why code that uses it will work in
containers an on non-selinux systems.

I will NAK the hell out of this until, at the very least, someone
documents what this means, how to parse it, what its stability rules
are, who is allowed to see the value it contains, why that value will
never evolve to become *more* security sensitive than it is now, etc.

Audit gets to do crazy sh*t because it's restricted to privileged
receivers.  This isn't restricted like that, so it doesn't deserve the
same dispensation.  (And, honestly, I'm not sure that audit really
deserves its free pass on making sense.)

Which name?  Can't there be several?

What if the receiver said that the item was mandatory?
