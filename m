Ritesh,

We have put immense labor and love in creating LIO and targetcli. Please
just take a look at the code, the wiki, the manual, target-devel - we have
poured years of our lives into this project, and we look forward to
implementing many more exciting ideas. Asking us to just abandon this is -
simply absurd. Of course, we'll continue to maintain one coherent software
stack with extensive documentation (we'd love contributions here, too!)
and provide support for all of it through a well-known forum
(target-devel).

If Andy prefers not helping us to pull his few changes upstream, we'll
gladly just do it ourselves.

Best regards,

Marc Fleischmann

Yes. Apart from reaching out the developers directly, I am not aware of
other communication channels. There is a git and wiki though.

Nick, if you guys have the same license now, nothing should stop you to
pull the changes from the targetcli-fb repo. You can start afresh now and
comply with what the community guidelines are. Licensing is just one part
of it.

And regarding this whole licensing dispute in the open, the kernel
maintainers should have resolved this long ago, when it was decided to
have LIO as the in-kernel target for Linux.
You might say that the target component complied by the kernel's licensing
requirements. But for a subsystem inclusion, you don't look just at the
code, but also the maintainer. Their support tools. And their long term
plans. These rules have been applied, in the past, for other features in
the kernel.
