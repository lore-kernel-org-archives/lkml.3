What do you mean? If you have a DIX-capable HBA (lpfc, qla2xxx, zfcp)
then integrity protection is active from the block layer down. The only
code that's not currently being exercised are the tag interleaving
functions.  I was hoping the FS people would use them for back pointers
but nobody seemed to bite.

I don't understand why multiqueue would require a lot of work? It's just
an extra scatterlist per request.

And obviously, if there's anything that needs to be done in this area
I'll be happy to do so...
