  Well, I was specifically worried about i_mutex locking. In particular:
Before we report appending IO completion we need to update i_size.
To update i_size we need to grab i_mutex.

Now this is unpleasant because inode_dio_wait() happens under i_mutex so
the above would create lock inversion. And we cannot really do
inode_dio_done() before grabbing i_mutex as that would open interesting
races between truncate decreasing i_size and DIO increasing it.
