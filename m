I'm afraid you'll need to propose another solution.  We have a large
selection of commands which, by design, retry until the command exceeds
it's timeout.  UA is one of those (as are most of the others you're
limiting).  How do you kick this device out of its UA return (because
that's the recovery that needs to happen)?
