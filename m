We can, but it involves quite a rewrite within the arm dma-mapping code
to use pfn instead of page.  It looks like it would make the code
cleaner because there are a lot of page_to_pfn transformations in there.
However, the current patch is the simplest one for stable and I don't
actually have any arm build and test environments.

No, fortunately, offset must be within the first page from the point of
view of block generated sg lists.  As long as nothing within arm
violates this, it should be a safe assumption ... although the code
seems to assume otherwise.

Looks reasonable modulo all the simplification we could do if we can
assume offset < PAGE_SIZE
