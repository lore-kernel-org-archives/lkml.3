Right, but on all 32-bit architectures other than x86, the I/O ports
are mapped into physical memory addresses, which means you can't
map all of the I/O space into the CPU address space. On 64-bit
architectures you can, but then it's UINT_MAX, not ULONG_MAX.

There is also the theoretical case of machines mapping a window
of I/O addresses with portnumber==phys_addr as we normally do
for PCI memory space, but I haven't seen anyone actually do that.
Practically every PCI implementation (if they have I/O space at all)
maps a small number of ports (65536 or 1048576 mostly) starting at
port number zero to a fixed physical CPU address.

Right. We should fix that, too.

Actually the behavior of /dev/port for >1 byte writes seems questionable
already: There are very few devices on which writing to consecutive
port numbers makes sense. Normally you just want to write a series
of bytes (or 16/32 bit words) into the same port number instead,
as the outsb()/outsw()/outsl() functions do.
