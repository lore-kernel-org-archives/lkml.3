Yeah, that works too. If Dave prefers to just remove these asserts
that's fine with me. I just wanted to make sure we aren't adding
spurious asserts for valid failures.

Hmm, fair point. That seems less critical to me than the general error
sequence, but if we want to handle that case I think we could still fix
the duplication in xfs_file_fallocate(). We could possibly factor out
the common bits (update time and set size) into a helper, or what seems
a bit cleaner on first thought, move the bulk of the (mode &
FALLOC_FL_INSERT_RANGE) block to after the common part. Then the
function looks something like this:

	...
	xfs_ilock();

	/* pre-inode fixup ops */
	if (mode & ...) {
		...
	} else if (mode & FALLOC_FL_INSERT_RANGE) {
		/* comment as to what's going on here :) */

		/* error checks */

		new_size = ...;
		do_file_insert = 1;
	}
	...
	xfs_trans_ichgtime();
	xfs_setattr_size();
	...

	/*
	 * Some operations are performed after the inode size is updated. For
	 * example, insert range expands the address space of the file, shifts
	 * all subsequent extents over and allocates space into the hole.
	 * Updating the size first ensures that shifted extents aren't left
	 * hanging past EOF in the event of a crash or failure.
	 */
	if (do_file_insert) {
		/* alloc space */
		...
	}
	...

That seems a bit cleaner to me, but I'm not wedded to it. Thoughts? It
might be worth soliciting some other thoughts/ideas before reworking it.
Thanks.
