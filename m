Absolutely. I will be posting a v4 patchset . Just waiting a bit more 
for more comments on v3.

The macro from v4 will look like this which I believe will satisfy the 
concern and indeed be safer than my previous version.

+#define SHASH_DESC_ON_STACK(shash, tfm)                                  \
+       char __##shash##_desc[sizeof(struct shash_desc) +        \
+               crypto_shash_descsize(tfm)] CRYPTO_MINALIGN_ATTR; \
+       struct shash_desc *shash = (struct shash_desc *)__##shash##_desc

Hmm. Is it worth adding a comment with this macro explaining the reason this works? Essentially much of what is in the commit message?

Wonderful!

Indeed. I would have asked for you to wait for v4 anyways. :)

Thank you,
