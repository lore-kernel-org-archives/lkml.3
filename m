The thing is, nfs-utils *did* make exactly this change with commit
6b4e4965a6b82e8d49cea1c0316b951ba4e9e83e "rpc.nfsd: No longer advertise
NFS v2 support." in 1.2.9-rc4 which entered f19 recently.  And that
kernel commit doesn't look related.  So I strongly suspect that you got
the nfs-utils update (or rebooted after the update) at the same time as
bisecting, and that confused the bisect results.

Digging into a historical git repo just for fun.... It looks like NFSv3
support was added in 2.3.99pre4-3, probably in 2000?  (The date on that
commit is 2007, so obviously this repo I have is very confused.  Maybe I
should go find if there's a better one someplace.)

So anyway it's either configured out of the kernel or the mount
commandline's asking for v2, or I don't know what....
