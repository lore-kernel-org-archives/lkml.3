I was reading a little quickly and assumed all these kernel versions
described the NFS server, now I understand you're varying only the NFS
client; so against that CentOS 2.6.32 server, you're seeing the problem
when the NFS client is 3.12.20 or 3.15-rc6, but not if the NFS client is
running the same CentOS 2.6.32 version.  Got it, sorry for the
confusion.

So with my upstream hat on that's a little less interesting since
upstream is pretty far from any 2.6.32-based kernel at this point.
