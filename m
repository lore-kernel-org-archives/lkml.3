I think so, it may race here. When error occurs during 
lpfc_pci_remove_one().

Yes, not all drivers do it.

Of course if driver can handle some hardware errors, it can call for 
reset not hotplug.

This assumption may be not safe, what will it be when faced hardware 
errors during probe state.

Yes, actually, it was not a problem before this patch:

967577b0  PCI/PM: Keep runtime PM enabled for unbound PCI devices

....
+       pci_dev->driver = pci_drv;
+       rc = pci_drv->probe(pci_dev, ddi->id);
......


This patch set pci_dev->driver before .probe, before, set it after probe 
success. So it will never be  invoked during driver .probe.

Maybe we can implement one mechanism that only after probe() and before 
removal() can pci_error_handlers works.

Totally agree :), but my patch is to solve a real bug(probe with 
hardware error).

The race case is a big issue, even though it has not been reported.

Now should wait Bjorn's and others' input.....
