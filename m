Hi Ted,

I should have really noticed this earlier. This test (shared/298)
have nothing to do with bigalloc, nor punch hole. It tests file
system discard implementation.

The most likely reason it failed for you is that the tests does not
count with bigalloc feature. However it seems to be working for me
without any problems. Can you provide more information about the
problem you've seen, or at least your xfstest configuration so we
can see what went wrong and possibly fix the test ?

Tom can you take a look at this ? (Adding Tomas Racek to the CC)

So, since this failure is not really related to the patch itself,
can we re-include the patch (it might be already too late I guess).

Thanks!
-Lukas
