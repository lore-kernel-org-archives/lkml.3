Thanks for your reply. I forgot to mention that removing other files seems to "fix" the problem, so it does not seem to be spefically the new file itself that is the cause.

I captured the "ls 3.14 | head" sequence on both the client and the server, and put the tcpudmp files here: http://hoho.duckdns.org/linux/ - let me know if that helped.

Meanwhile I'll try older/plain (unpatched) kernels. So far reverting the client to vanilla 3.18.1 or 3.14.27 has not helped..

Thanks,
Holger
