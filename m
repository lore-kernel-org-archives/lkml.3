The answer is not to return NFS4ERR_DELAY on seqid-modifying operations.

The source server can return NFS4ERR_DELAY to the client's migration recovery operations (the GETATTR(fs_locations) request) for example.

Or, the server could return it on the initial PUTFH operation in a compound containing seqid-modifying operations.
