(time_t)-1 already has this meaning for some calls (e.g. time(2)).
However, this also means Wed Dec 31 23:59:59 UTC 1969, and unfortunately
something similar applies to all possible bit patterns, certainly within
the range of an int.

This assumes that we actually know that that is the case, which may be
an aggressive assumption.
