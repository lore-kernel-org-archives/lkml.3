Subject: [PATCH] Kconfig: Remove hotplug enable hints in CONFIG_KEXEC help texts
Date: Tue, 20 Aug 2013 21:38:03 +0200
Message-Id: <1377027483-17025-1-git-send-email-geert@linux-m68k.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 1.7.9.5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

commit 40b313608ad4ea655addd2ec6cdd106477ae8e15 ("Finally eradicate
CONFIG_HOTPLUG") removed remaining references to CONFIG_HOTPLUG, but missed
a few plain English references in the CONFIG_KEXEC help texts.

Remove them, too.
