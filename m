We're aware of #4. That was the intent of adding try_to_freeze() into
this codepath in the first place. It's not a great solution for obvious
reasons, but we don't have another at the moment.

For #1 I'm not sure what to do. I'm that familiar with cgroups or how
the freezer works.

The bottom line is that we have a choice -- we can either rip out this
new lockdep warning, or rip out the code that causes it to fire.

If we rip out the warning we may miss some legit cases where we might
possibly have hit a deadlock.

If we rip out the code that causes it to fire, then we exacerbate the
#4 problem above. That will effectively make it so that you can't
suspend the host whenever NFS is doing anything moderately active.

Ripping out the warning seems like the best course of action in the
near term, but it's not my call...
