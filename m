Kees currently all these files can be used to leak data, except for
/proc/*/{mem,environ}

These are the only one that pin the mm at open time. But I'm not sure
that this solution will work for /proc/*/maps since they need vma info
which will be perhaps freed if task execv,  Need to check it.

> Regardless, glibc uses /proc/self/maps, which would be fine here, right?
I did not touch /proc/self/maps and others, but I'm planning to fix them
if this solution is accepted.

I'll do the same thing as in /proc/*/stat for maps, let it be 0444, and
try to delay the check to ->read(). So during ->read() perform
ptrace_may_access() on currenct's cred and process_allow_access() on
file's opener cred. This should work.
