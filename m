The use-case this solves is when a userspace process does not control
(or know) when a thread is spawned (e.g. via shared library init, or
LD_PRELOAD) but wants to make sure seccomp filters have been applied
to it. Specifically, Chrome, when loading some proprietary graphics
drivers, will have those drivers spawning threads before there has
been an ability to call seccomp. While some games can be played to get
ahead of it, it's not always possible, or racey, depending on the
drivers. With seccomp thread-sync, we can be certain that all threads
have had the filter applied.

I got irq lock dep warnings without these changes. If they're
unneeded, that's totally fine by me, but some change (either this or
markings to keep lockdep happy) is needed.

Okay. I wasn't sure if I needed to be extra careful here or not. I
opted for just using lock_task_sighand since that seemed to be the
most used. :)
