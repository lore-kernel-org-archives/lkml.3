Not leaking the abstraction into the driver is always worth the effort.

But looking at the other patches I haven't reviewed yet I think the
issue is more severe anyway, see my next reply.

It's the same issue for any hardware driver that directly maps a
se_cmd - the direction the target expects is reversed to what the
driver expects, in addition any BIDI or other special meanings will
need handling.
