I don't see any point to force the aligmnet - the devices need to reject
garbage commands, and if for some reason we'd see future commands

No good reason except that's what sg and bsg do.

The sg changes to support > 16 byte CDs remove the comment, take a look at my
core-for-3.17 tree which has them applied.

Honestly that whole filter crap should never have been merged to start with,
you'll just need proper CAP_SYS_RAWIO for variable length commands.
