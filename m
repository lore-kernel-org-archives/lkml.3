(Including the Linux API list due to the additions to /proc/<pid>/ns/.
Please see http://www.kernelhub.org/?p=2&msg=477668 and in particular
http://www.kernelhub.org/?msg=477678&p=2 )

Breaking this out into a seperate record type would mean calling
audit_log_namespace_info() from the callers of audit_log_task_info()
(presently audit_log_link_denied(), ima_audit_measurement(),
audit_log_exit() ), but would make it easier to emit with other record
types.

Steve, how do you feel about this since the NS_INIT/NS_DEL record type
would have changing fields amongst the 6 namespace types.  Only one of
the 6 would be present in each message.  I suppose we could have an
NS_INIT_XXX/NS_DEL_XXX for each namespace type.
