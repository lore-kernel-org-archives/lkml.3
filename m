An uncontended futex is taken without ever going into kernel
space. Adaptive spinning allows short duration futexes to be
taken without going into kernel space.

Only long held locks cause a thread to go into kernel space,
where it goes to sleep, freeing up the cpu, and increasing
the chance that the lock holder will run.
