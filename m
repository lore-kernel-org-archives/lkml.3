As a bystander, what I understand to be happening is:

1. the Kernel developers are saying that multiple hierarchies is causing lots of 
problems, and so they are starting the migration to a unified hierarchy. In the 
near term this will be optional, at a later (unspecified) point, it will no 
longer be optional.

It is recognized that this is an API break, but the problem is bad enough (too 
much undefined behavior) that it looks like they are going to do this anyway.


2. indpendantly from this, the systemd people have declared that systemd is 
going to take control of this unified hierarchy and all applications had better 
use DBUS calls to systemd to make any cgroup changes or else. (i.e. systemd may 
break whatever you are doing)


I don't think the kernel developers are talking about changing ways to control 
cgroups, just eliminating having multiple hierarchies.



Now, I could be completely misunderstanding this (and I expect to hear about it 
if I am :-)
