Sure, I understand that quite well.  But Ted was also saying that perhaps selinux had "gotten piggy" and was causing this.  I've showed that it hasn't.


This matters because unless the selinux xattrs go out of the inode into their own block, mbcache should STILL not come into it at all.

And for attrs < 100 bytes, they stay in the inode.  And on inspection, my SELinux boxes have no external attr blocks allocated.

mbcache only handles extended attributes that live in separately-allocated blocks, and selinux does not cause that on its own.

Soo... selinux by itself should not be triggering any mbcache codepaths.

Ted suggested that "selinux had gotten piggy" so I checked, and showed that it hadn't.  That's all.

So at this point I think it's up to Mak to figure out why on his system, aim7 is triggering mbcache codepaths.
