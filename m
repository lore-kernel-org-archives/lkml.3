In sg3_utils there are now string yielding equivalents
to the sense buffer "print" functions. They take a form
like this:
   char * get_sense_str(const unsigned char * sense_buffer,
                        int sb_len, int blen, char * b);

So this just does the hard work of decoding the sense buffer
(or saying it is invalid) the result of which it places in
buffer 'b'. And 'b' is returned (so this function can be in
the arguments of a driver's printing function).

Adding such string functions would give other parts of the
SCSI subsystem the capability of tailoring their own
messages that include sense data information.


Existing sense buffer "print" function could be kept and
implemented using the newer "_str" variants. Would that
be worth the trouble?
