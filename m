Yes, your are right, so how about below?

In fact, I had wrote and tested your attached patch before my last post,
and it may trigger BUG() in mpage_release_unused_pages(), that is because
we touch mpd->next_page without locking current page, so it is better to
not increase mpd->next_page if the current page won't be processed.
