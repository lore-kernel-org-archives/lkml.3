Thanks James for looking at this patch.

Let's assume this scenario.
PAGE_SIZE = 4096 (4K),
2 page descriptors (as mentioned commit text) whose own addresses are 
discontingous but they point to physically contiguous memory space, 
sizeof(struct page) is 36 bytes.
Only one SG node created in Scatter Gather list (by blk_rq_map_sg) with 
this node's page_link=0xc1e43fdc, length=8192, offset=0

Now consider this call stack from MMC block driver (this is on the ARmv7 
based board):

dma_cache_maint_page() function iterates through each page in single sg 
node, maps it to virtual space and then call the cache maintainance 
operation on that page.

With above scenario, first page descriptor would be 0xc1e43fdc, which 
would be mapped virtual address by either kmap() (if it's higmem page) 
or by page_address() (if it's low mem page).

Now as the size of the sg node is 8192 bytes, dma_cache_maint_page() 
function increments the page pointer (pointed by page_link of sg node) 
to get to the next descriptor. page++ would yield page descriptor 
address = 0xc1e44000 (0xc1e43fdc + sizeof (struct page)). 0xc1e44000 is 
not pointing any real page descriptor so when calls 
page_address(0xc1e44000) to get virtual address of the page, it returns 
invalid virtual address. Now when we try to dereference that invalid 
virtual address in cache maintainance functions, it would result into 
"Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address xxxxxxxx" 
error and kernel crashes.
