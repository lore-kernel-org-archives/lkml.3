I don't really follow the last part.  So, the difference is that
cooperating queue setup also takes place during bio merge too, right?
Are you trying to say that it's beneficial to detect cooperating
queues before the issuing queue gets unplugged because the two queues
might deviate while plugged?  If so, the above paragraph is, while
quite wordy, a rather lousy description.

You mean the cfq_rq_close() preemption, right?  Hmmm... interesting.
I'm a bit bothered that we might do this multiple times for the same
bio/request.  e.g. if bio is back merged to an existing request which
would be the most common bio merge scenario anyway, is it really
meaningful to retry it for each merge and then again on submission?
cfq does it once when allocating the request.  That seems a lot more
reasonable to me.  It's doing that once for one start sector.  I mean,
plugging is usually extremely short compared to actual IO service
time.  It's there to mask the latencies between bio issues that the
same CPU is doing.  I can't see how this earliness can be actually
useful.  Do you have results to back this one up?  Or is this just
born out of thin air?

Use lockdep_assert_held() instead?

You can simply write the following.

	abs64(sector0 - sector1) < BFQQ_SEEKTHR;

Note that abs64() works whether the source type is signed or unsigned.
Also, please don't do "void *" + type switch.  If it absoluately has
to take two different types of pointers, just take two different
pointers and BUG_ON() if both are set, but here this doesn't seem to
be the case.  Just pass around the actual sectors.  This applies to
all usages of void *io_struct.

bfqq_find_close() or find_close_bfqq()?

If you're gonna do the above, please use proper function comment.
Please take a look at Documentation/kernel-doc-nano-HOWTO.txt.

Why are some of these conditions tested twice?  Once here and once in
the caller?  Collect them into one place?

This is the only place this rq position tree is being used, right?
Any reason not to use per-parent tree instead?

Test ioprio_class for equality?

Why don't in_service_queue and scheduled search share the cooperation
conditions?  They should be the same, right?  Shouldn't the function
be structured like the following instead?

	if (bfq_try_close_cooperator(current_one, in_service_one))
		return in_service_one;

	found = bfq_find_close_cooperator();
	if (bfq_try_close_cooperator(current_one, found))
		return found;
	return NULL;

Thanks.
