Because if you randomly hotplug cpus your tasks can randomly flip
between sets.

Therefore there is no strict containment and no guarantees.

No currently we hard break affinity and never look back. That move to
parent and back crap is all new fangled stuff, and broken because of the
above argument.

See above, by pretending hotplug is a sane operation you loose all
guarantees.

That's just a horrible piece of crap hack and you deserve any and all
pain you get from doing it.

Randomly removing/adding cpus like that is horrible and makes a mockery
of all the affinity interfaces we have.
