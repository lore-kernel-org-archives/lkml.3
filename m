Overall this is very good.

This doesn't quite make sense, because the runtime_suspend callback 
_is_ the runtime-suspend function.  How about "... should be called 
near the start of the device's runtime_suspend callback."?

A similar comment applies to the other functions.

I would hypenate some of these words, such as "runtime-PM-related
fields" or "request-based runtime PM".  Also, "runtime_suspend" and 
"runtime_resume" generally should have either a '_' or a '-'.

But that's a very minor point; your descriptions are quite good.
