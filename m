Well, I'd actually much prefer disabling CDB whitelisting for all !MMC
devices if at all possible. You're basically arguing that because what
we have is already broken, it should be okay to break it further.
Also, RW commands having more quirks doesn't necessarily indicate that
they tend to be more broken. They just get hammered on a lot in
various ways so problems on those commands tend to be more noticeable.

The thing is that both approaches aren't perfect here so you can make
similar type of argument from the other side. If the system wants to
give out raw hardware access to VMs, requiring it to delegate the
device fully could be reasonable. Not ideal but widening direct
command access by default is pretty nasty too.
