I just made wanted to share some progress on this. And I apologize for
for all these different threads (this, LSF/FS and then Jermey and
Volker).

I recently implemented cifs support (via libsmbcli) for FIO so I can
have some hard numbers on the benchmarks. So all you guys will be
seeing more data soon enough. It's going to take a bit of time to put
it together because it takes a lot of time to benchmark to make sure
we have correct and non-noisy numbers.

In the meantime I have some numbers from my first run here:
http://i.imgur.com/05SMu8d.jpg

Sorry for the link to the image, it was easier. The test case is a
single FIO client doing 4K random reads, on localhost smbd server, on
a fully cached file for 10 minutes with a 1 minute warm up.

Threadpool + preadv2 for fast read does much better in terms of
bandwidth and a bit better in terms of latency. Sync is still the
fastest, but the gap is narrowed. Not a bad improvement for (Volker's)
9 line change to samba code.

Also, I look into why the gap between sync and threadpool + preadv2 is
not even smaller. From my preliminary investigation it looks like the
async threadpool code path does a lot more work then the sync call...
even in the case we do the fast read. According to perf the hotest
code userspace (smbd+ library) is malloc + free. So I imagine the
optimizing the fast read case to avoid a bunch of extra request
allocations will bring us even closer to sync.

Again, I'll have and more complex test cases soon just wanted to share
progress. I imagine that they'll the gap between threadpool + preadv2
and just threadpool is going to get wider as add more blocking calls
into the queue. I'll have number on that as soon as week can.
