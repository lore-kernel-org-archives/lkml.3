My idea is twofold: The software-RNGs currently available (X9.31 and 
DRBG) use other ciphers as backends. Therefore, they can be considered 
as transforms on top of these backend ciphers. Now, if these backend 
ciphers are available in kernel mode only, currently only these in-
kernel RNGs can use the hardware.

With the consideration of AEAD, all ciphers supported by the kernel 
crypto API are available to user space. That means, there is no need for 
an additional crypto library in user space in addition to provide 
hardware access. The RNG part is there to complement the case for not 
needing an additional crypto lib in user space.

Ciao
Stephan
