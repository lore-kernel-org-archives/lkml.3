I cant reproduce this one yet.
But changes {ext3,jbd} are minimal
#git log --oneline v3.9.. fs/{ext3,jbd}
5af43c2 Merge branch 'akpm' (incoming from Andrew)
a27bb33 aio: don't include aio.h in sched.h
4385bab make blkdev_put() return void
14a9e5c Merge branch 'for_linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jack/linux-fs
e760040 fs/buffer.c: remove unnecessary init operation after allocating buffer_head.
713685111 mm: make snapshotting pages for stable writes a per-bio
operation
8bb9da9 jbd: use kmem_cache_zalloc for allocating journal head
e162b2f jbd: use kmem_cache_zalloc instead of kmem_cache_alloc/memset
e678a4f jbd: don't wait (forever) for stale tid caused by wraparound
e643692 ext3: fix data=journal fast mount/umount hang

So looks very strange..
I have ia64 and now I work on reproduction.
