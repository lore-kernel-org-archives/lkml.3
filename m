Hi Arnd,

First things first, nospace_cache is a safe thing to use.  It is slow
because it's finding free extents, but it's just a cache and always safe
to discard.  With your other errors, I'd just mount it readonly
and then you won't waste time on atime updates.

I'll take a look at the BUG you got during log recovery.  We've fixed a
few of those during the 3.8 rc cycle.

These aren't good.  With a few exceptions for really tight races in fsx
use cases, csum errors are bad data from the disk.  The transid verify
failed shows we wanted to find a metadata block from generation 54700
but found 54764 instead:

54700 = 0xD5AC
54764 = 0xD5EC

This same bad block comes up a few different times.

> Jan 21 16:35:40 localhost kernel: [1655047.752692] btrfs read error corrected: ino 1 off 17006399488 (dev /dev/sdb1 sector 64689288)

This shows we pulled from the second copy of this block and got the
right answer, and then wrote the right answer to the duplicate.
Inode 1 means it was metadata.

But for some reason still aborted the transaction.  It could have been
an EIO on the correction, but the auto correction code in 3.5 did work
well.

I think your plan to pull the data off and reformat is a good one.  I'd
also look hard at your ram since drives don't usually send back single bit
errors.
