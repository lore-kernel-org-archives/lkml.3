I added some in 3.12 :)

Ok, I can do that. But AFAIK it'll have to be an smp_rmb(); there is
no mb__after unlock.

[ After thinking about it some, I don't think preventing speculative
   writes before clearing PENDING if useful or necessary, so that's
   why I'm suggesting only the rmb. ]

Yeah, it seems like the work item lifetime is at least guaranteed
while either PENDING is set _or_ while the pool->lock is held
after PENDING is cleared.
