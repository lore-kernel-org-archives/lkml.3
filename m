Since that commit was written to fix a problem with certain cdrom
drives, maybe we would work around the issue by modifying the commit.  
Have it go back to the original behavior if the device isn't a cdrom 
drive.

That's not a complete fix (it won't help when a CD drive is attached 
via USB), but maybe it's better than nothing.
