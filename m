Remember we do shared (all queue) tags on qla, aic and a few other
drivers (it's actually the mailbox slot tag for the HBA).

Tag space is dependent on SCSI protocol.  It's 256 for SPI, 65536 for
SAS and I'm not sure for FCP.

The list seems to be missing prior context but a few SPI drivers use the
clock algorithm for tag starvation in the driver.  The NCR ones are the
ones I know about: tag allocation is the hands of a clock sweeping
around (one for last tag and one for last outstanding tag).  The hands
are never allowed to cross, so if a tag gets starved the hands try to
cross and the driver stops issuing until the missing tag returns.  Tag
starvation used to be a known problem for Parallel devices; I haven't
seen much in the way of tag starvation algorithms for other types of
devices, so I assume the problem went away.
