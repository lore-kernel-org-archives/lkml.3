I don't see the problem for xfs or btrfs either.

xfs uses generic_writepages, which already does the right thing.  (xfs
with my updated patches passes my tests.)  xfs_vm_writepage calls
xfs_start_page_writeback(..., 1, ...), so clear_page_dirty_for_io is
called.  At that point (I presume), it would still be possible to add
metadata to a transaction (assuming there's a transaction open -- I
don't have a clue here).  Even if this is too late, xfs_vm_writepage
could call page_mkwrite to for AS_CMTIME to be set if needed.
page_mkwrite will be fast if the page isn't mmapped.  What am I
missing?

btrfs seems to do much the same thing.
