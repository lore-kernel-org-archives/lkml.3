Yep, good spot.

I'll send out an updated patchset with this approach, but I have a slight
reservation. Given that /dev/fd is a symlink to /proc/self/fd, this approach
means that script invocations will always fail on a /proc-less system,
where the previous iteration might have worked.

(As it happens, this isn't a restriction that affects the things I'm
working on, as Capsicum wouldn't allow script invocation anyway.
However, scenarios without /proc were nominally one of the motivating
factors for execveat in the first place...)

FYI, there is potential in the future for something other than static
executables -- the FreeBSD Capsicum implementation includes changes
to the dynamic linker to get its search path as a list of pre-opened dfds
(in LD_LIBRARY_PATH_FDS) rather than paths.
