Thanks for the quick reply.

MADV_FREE semantic want it.

When madvise syscall is called, VM clears dirty bit of ptes of
the range. If memory pressure happens, VM checks dirty bit of
page table and if it found still "clean", it means it's a
"lazyfree pages" so VM could discard the page instead of swapping out.
Once there was store operation for the page before VM peek a page
to reclaim, dirty bit is set so VM can swap out the page instead of
discarding to keep up-to-date contents.

If it's hard on s390, maybe we could use just reference bit
instead of dirty bit to check recent access but it might change
semantic a bit with other OSes. :(
