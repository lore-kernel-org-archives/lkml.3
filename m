Well, we can do both together if both are wanted.  The changelogs are
very skimpy on pwritev2().  A full description and careful
justification in the [0/n] changelog would be useful - something that
tells us "what's wrong with O_DSYNC+pwrite".

I can see all that, but it's handwaving.  Yes, preadv2() will perform
better in some circumstances than fincore+pread.  But how much better? 
Enough to justify this approach, or not?

Alas, the only way to really settle that is to implement fincore() and
to subject it to a decent amount of realistic quantitative testing.

Ho hum.

Could you please hunt down some libuv developers, see if we can solicit
some quality input from them?  As I said, we really don't want to merge
this then find that people don't use it for some reason, or that it
needs changes.
