Well, the only comment I have is that the source of these functions was
commit d310310c (Freezer / sunrpc / NFS: don't allow TASK_KILLABLE sleeps to
block the freezer) and they were added because people were complaining that
they couldn't suspend while their NFS servers were not responding, IIRC.

I agree that they are not really nice.

Thanks,
Rafael
