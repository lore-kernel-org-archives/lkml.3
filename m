Well sure, hashing, plist handling, wakeups etc. (not to mention
dirtying cachelines). The "fast" in futex is only due to the fact that
there is no jump to kernel space when the lock is uncontended after say,
a successful cmpxchg in user space. Once futex(2) is actually called,
performance is quite a different story.

Agreed, with the critical regions being correctly sized for spinning
locks.

With the pi_state there would be no such distinction.
