Just when you got back I started my pre-vacation work stress and am now 
ending my post-vacation work-stress.. :)

That iostat -x 1 shows %util as 100 and w_await at 2,000 - 70,000.. like so:

avg-cpu:  %user   %nice %system %iowait  %steal   %idle
            9.05    0.00    1.51   66.33    0.00   23.12
Device:         rrqm/s   wrqm/s     r/s     w/s    rkB/s    wkB/s 
avgrq-sz avgqu-sz   await r_await w_await  svctm  %util
sda               0.00     0.00    0.00    1.00     0.00   184.00 
368.00   137.08 62199.00    0.00 62199.00 1000.00 100.00

Sure, but I suspect it'll take until the worst is over before it manages 
to load and execute that "echo w".

Yes, sure. If I run nothing else then it's not so severe, but the system 
is still quite unusable during the time it runs that dd.

Also, the speeds are closer to an Amiga500-era floppy drive than to an 
SSD from 2012 which this is:

$ dd if=/dev/zero of=iotest-file bs=1M count=200 oflag=direct
200+0 records in
200+0 records out
209715200 bytes (210 MB) copied, 171.701 s, 1.2 MB/s
