It's dying on pr_cont_kernfs_name which is some tree that has "kernfs: 
implement kernfs_get_parent(), kernfs_name/path() and friends", which is 
not in linux-next, and is obviously printing the cpuset cgroup name.

It doesn't look like it has anything at all to do with btrfs or why they 
would care about this failure.
