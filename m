What I tried was patch below, but it didn't have any observable effect -- 
the commands sent to the controller would still time out the same way.

Debugging this is not really straightforward for me unfortunately, as I 
don't own the system myself.

I agree that we don't fully understand what is happening, but the quirk 
was the only way I have been able to come up with to make the device 
functioning again (apart from reverting d5dea7d95).

Any other ideas are welcome.
