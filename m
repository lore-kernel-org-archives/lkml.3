Imagine I set up my machine to audit all user access to super secret
information.  With your patch set all an malicious user has to do is
create a new user namespace.  Now when he accesses the super secret
information it will be logged inside the user namespace he created.  So
he can just dump those logs in the trash.

I believe that each audit namespace should require priv
(CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL) in the user namespace that created the current audit
namespace.  So lets say the machine boots and we are in the init_user
and init_audit namespace.  Creating a new audit namespace should require
CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL in the init_user namespace.  If instead we spawned a
new user namespace userns1 and try to create a new audit namespace, we
should STILL check for CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL in the init_user namespace.

Assuming we've spawned auditns1 in userns1 and want to spawn auditns2 it
should require CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL in userns1.  So now you only have
permission to change your audit config (create a new audit namespace) if
you already had permission to change your current audit config.

Now how to handle coding this...

When the kernel receives an audit message on the netlink socket it can
always check the current->[whatever] to figure out which audit namespace
it came from.  Then it can be processed accordingly...

Sending messages to the userspace auditd is a little more tricky.  We
need to somehow map the audit namespace to a socket connected to auditd
in userspace.  I'd imagine we'd have to either have per auditns backlog
queues and run one kauditd per audit namespace, or we'd have to tag the
skb's with the intended namespace somehow and then find the right socket
in kauditd.  Either way it doesn't seem too onerous (although I admit, I
don't know how to code the per namespace kauditd right offhand)
