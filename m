As mentioned several times, I'm working on a patchset to update
scsi logging.

The original patchset tried to convert any logging message into a 
single statement, which wouldn't be broken up even under heavy load.

While this works reasonably well for most things, printing out 
decoded sense with just one line (and not end up in massive switch()
statements) is near impossible.

Plus you'll end up having to use a static buffer at one point, which
again increases the stack size.

The alternative approach as discussed at LSF is to move scsi_logging
over to tracing. There is already some coding for scsi tracing, but
in most cases it just duplicates existing logging statements.
So if we were to replace the entire scsi_logging infrastructure
with scsi tracing most of the issues (like chopped-up CDBs) would
be gone.
Plus we would have a far better control about _what_ is being printed.

And yes, I do have some patches for that :-)

Cheers,

Hannes
