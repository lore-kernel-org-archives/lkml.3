Changing that would break containers for users on many common Linux
distributions, which put users in various supplementary groups by
default.

I do actually have another patch planned, to allow users to set up gid
maps for groups they currently have permission for, not just for their
primary group.  But even with that change, breaking the ability for
container-root to use setgroups to drop all its supplementary groups
seems very wrong, and seems highly likely to break real-world software
running in containers.

Both sg and newgrp do prove a different point, though: an unprivileged
user should be able to change their gid to one of their supplementary
groups.  That's another patch I planned to submit after this one:
allow setgid/setresgid/etc to a supplementary group ID.

no_new_privs already exists in large part to support such use cases,
such as setting seccomp filters, which would be dangerous for
privilege-escalating programs to inherit.

Seeking the decades-old precedents and corner cases that might
contradict the most obvious semantics is a large part of what I'm
looking for out of this thread.

However, I don't necessarily think that we must permit unprivileged
setgroups in *all* cases if we permit it in *any*; it may well make
sense to reduce the surface area of the change by limiting the
circumstances in which you can do this.  Whether it does end up making
sense to do so depends on the outcome of this discussion.

I added the no_new_privs check at Andy's suggestion, since the use case
I had in mind will work just fine with that restriction.  I'm also open
to just allowing setgroups in all cases, if that semantic seems
preferable, or to adding some separate check specific to this case if
that really seems necessary.
