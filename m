I disagree - UNMAP will only be used if the vpd pages say that UNMAP is
supported by the device. I've added two hard disks (one SATA, one on USB) to
the VM and here's the debug output with all three patches applied and some
extra logging:

The hard disk never set the Discard mode so why would UNMAP be forced.

OK this one I can't deny but I couldn't see how else to cope with passthrough
disks (see below)...

Let me be clear that there are two cases:

1. Hyper-V VHDX files.
2. Passthrough devices (such as SSDs) that support discard.

We can definitely identify 1. (and I have an unposted patch that
modified the struct in scsi_devinfo.c to only quirk on Hyper-V VHDX
devices) but with 2. the SATA SSD I have enables discard fine with Linux
on the host directly - it's the act of passing it through Hyper-V that
causes the issue (no SCSI conformance level is claimed and lbmpe is not
set) and that could theoretically apply to all TRIM supporting SATA SSDs
that are passed through Hyper-V.

Additionally K. Y.  Srinivasan had a similar (but slightly different)
patch to my unposted one and Christoph said:

So it was changed to be similar to impact everything attached to
Hyper-V. If you don't like this you may want to chime in on
https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/7/24/33 (Re: [PATCH 1/1] Drivers: scsi:
storvsc: Add blist flags).
