Austin,
That seems better then my idea as you seem to be more up to date on
brtfs devolopment.
If you and the other developers of brtfs are interested in adding this
as a feature please let
me known as I would like to help improve brtfs as the file system as
an idea is great just
seems like it needs a lot of work :).
Nick
