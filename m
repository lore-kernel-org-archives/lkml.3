If this is the approach you'd prefer, I'll go ahead and do that for v2.
I personally think it looks pretty kludgey, but I'm fine either way:

AFS doesn't implement ->bmap or ->swap_activate, so that code is dead,
probably cargo-culted from the NFS code. It seems pretty pointless, not
only because it's inconsistent with the local filesystems like you
mentioned, but also because it's trivial to bypass with O_DIRECT on NFS:

ssize_t nfs_file_write(struct kiocb *iocb, struct iov_iter *from)
{
	struct file *file = iocb->ki_filp;
	struct inode *inode = file_inode(file);
	unsigned long written = 0;
	ssize_t result;
	size_t count = iov_iter_count(from);
	loff_t pos = iocb->ki_pos;

	result = nfs_key_timeout_notify(file, inode);
	if (result)
		return result;

	if (file->f_flags & O_DIRECT)
		return nfs_file_direct_write(iocb, from, pos);

	dprintk("NFS: write(%pD2, %zu@%Ld)\n",
		file, count, (long long) pos);

	result = -EBUSY;
	if (IS_SWAPFILE(inode))
		goto out_swapfile;

I think it's safe to scrap that code. However, this also led me to find that
NFS doesn't prevent truncates on an active swapfile. I'm submitting a patch for
that now.
