Note that ->read_iter for direct-io supports async I/O in general.  By
resurrecting some of the older attempts to do in-kernel aio this could
be made async easily.

Right, we'd need to look into.  Bonus points of allowing this as a zero
copy read.


Btw, in the long run I would much prefer killing of the current horrible
swap using bmap path in favor of an enhanced direct I/O path.
