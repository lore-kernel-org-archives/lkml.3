Good point. I got confused between -1 and -2. I think Solaris uses
(uid_t)-2 for nobody. Using -1 in this case should be fine.

That's probably what I'd suggest. Allow one persistent keyring per
user, and expect userland to organize things sanely under it.

nit: I probably wouldn't call the top-level keyring "krb_cache"
though ;)

Possibly. It really comes down to what sort of lifecycle you expect here.

Some applications might be caught by surprise if the per-user keyring
was already populated in certain situations. OTOH, they have the same
problem if there's even one running process with that uid so maybe it's
not a big deal.

If you do this, it might make sense to allow the admin to tune the
expiry sysctl in such a way that user keyrings go away as soon as
the last reference is gone (maybe by setting it to 0?).
