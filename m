Yeah, I was summarizing all the points that I raised during the
review.  This part is almost there but still not quite there.

The thing is that the behavior change is now implemented in an
inactive form by #2 and then flipped on by #3.  #2 both change the
format and the content of the table.  This should have been like the
following.

#2: Convert to the new table for mat but set all bits for all commands
    as that's what the old table looks like in the new format.

#3: Implement per-type filtering.  Now this wouldn't change any
    behavior as the new table is the same as the old one.  This can be
    rolled into #2.

#4: Update the filtering table to fix the security issue and *just*
    the identified security issue with UNMAP.  This way, the behavior
    change is limited to the identified security issue and distros can
    backport upto this to address the security issue.

#5: Update the filtering table further so that commands which don't
    make sense for the class are not allowed.  Note that this has some
    possibility of breaking existing users and we do want this in a
    separate patch from #4.

One thing I don't get is why you're saying the original patch 3
"introduces some semantic changes, albeit very limited" because the
update to the command table in the previous patch is rather extensive.
Why do you say it's very limited?

Hmmmm.... so the thing is that it took us a lot of fighting and
bickering for the patchset to look like what it looks like right now
and I clearly recall talking about minimal fixes for the identified
security issue.  It's just exhausting that it still isn't split
properly after so much effort and to have to continue the same type of
point-by-point fight to get the rest of them across, especially when
none of these points are controversial at all.

Yeah, well, probably Jens was busy at the moment or something and then
there were activities related to the changes, so it got delayed until
the whole series is resolved.  Anyways, my point was that you wanna
put that right after the security fix, not at the end of the series
with contentious changes in the middle.  That way, the security fix
and the part that your use case requires can be picked up separately.
In fact, at this point, it chould be helpful to make them separate
patchset.

So, as I've said multiple times, let's *please* do this case-by-base -
build the command table gradually with explicit use cases at each
stage because SG_IO is very easy to get wrong for both the users and
the hardware devices and the kernel isn't policing the content of
what's being issued, because it is very nice to be able to know
exactly the intents behind such table contents later, and because we
wanna debate whether we even want to support specific use cases.  It's
one thing to allow WRITE SAME passthrough and it's a different thing
to try to allow all commands which may be issued by udev.

So does giving out access to the device node itself.  While it could
be cumbersome, requiring privileges there for arbitration isn't a new
thing.

So, your use case wouldn't work with this?

Yeah, that's still nack.

I did read.  Here's the patch description from patch 5.

 Start cleaning up the table, moving out of the way four rare &
 obsolete device types: printers, communication devices (network
 cards) and scanners (both TYPE_PROCESSOR and TYPE_SCANNER).  Add
 missing commands for these four device types.

No real discussion or justifications for those "missing commands".
Similar deal for other patches.  If I argue about command X to make a
general point, what I get is "all - X".  Build from ground up, not the
other way around.

Yeah, that one was better than others, but it still doesn't explain
and justify why those specific commands are being added.
