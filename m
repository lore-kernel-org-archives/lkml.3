Definitely. Stealth infiltration needs a high reliability expoit, 
especially if the attack vector used is a zero day kernel vulnerability.

Injecting uncertainty gives us a chance to get a crash logged and the 
vulnerability exposed.

I consider it a plus on kernel development - the more incentives to plug 
infoleaks, the better.

Definitely.

Correct, that's the motivation behind kptr_restrict and dmsg_restrict.

The other aspect of even just a couple of bits of extra entropy is that it 
changes the economics of worms and other remote attacks: there's a 
significant difference between being able to infect one machine per packet 
and only 1 out of 256 machines while the other 255 get crashed.

The downside is debuggability - so things like 'debug' on the kernel boot 
command line should probably disable this feature automatically.

Thanks,
