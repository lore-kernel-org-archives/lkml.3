Me too.  I think the quirks approach is unsupportable.  Worst case I
think we should have an ability for the *driver* to mark the region as
having strange access rules.

We could ... the OS could trigger a page fault on every access using the
COW mechanism ... however, that mechanism wasn't intended for write
combining, so although it's theoretically possible to add it, I'd be a
bit wary.

Pure protections are done at the page level.  That said, you can emulate
offset protections by marking the page inaccessible in the CPU, which
causes a trap on every access.  Then you can mediate the write based on
its address.  That said, this is a bit complex and we don't really have
the mechanism for it.
