Why not set the dma_dev after you call device_add()?  That way you will
pick up the right parent no matter what.

Ah, ok, it's a scsi core thing, not a driver core thing, that's less
confusing now.  For a "fallback" of a platform device, if you switch the
lines around you should be fine, something like this patch perhaps:
