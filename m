Subject: [RFC PATCH 00/14] nfsd/sunrpc: add support for a workqueue-based nfsd

tl;dr: this code works and is much simpler than the dedicated thread
       pool, but there are some latencies in the workqueue code that
       seem to keep it from being as fast as it could be.

This patchset is a little skunkworks project that I've been poking at
for the last few weeks. Currently nfsd uses a dedicated thread pool to
handle RPCs, but that requires maintaining a rather large swath of
"fiddly" code to handle the threads and transports.

This patchset represents an alternative approach, which makes nfsd use
workqueues to do its bidding rather than a dedicated thread pool. When a
transport needs to do work, we simply queue it to the workqueue in
softirq context and let it service the transport.

The current draft is runtime-switchable via a new sunrpc pool_mode
module parameter setting. When that's set to "workqueue", nfsd will use
a workqueue-based service. One of the goals of this patchset was to
*not* need to change any userland code, so starting it up using rpc.nfsd
still works as expected. The only real difference is that the nfsdfs
"threads" file is reinterpreted as the "max_active" value for the
workqueue.

This code has a lot of potential to simplify nfsd significantly and I
think it may also scale better on larger machines. When testing with an
exported tmpfs on my craptacular test machine, the workqueue based code
seems to be a little faster than a dedicated thread pool.

Currently though, performance takes a nose dive (~%40) when I'm writing
to (relatively slow) SATA disks. With the help of some tracepoints, I
think this is mostly due to some significant latency in the workqueue
code.

When I queue a thread using the legacy dedicated thread pool, I see
~.2ms of latency between the softirq function queueing it to a given
thread and the thread picking that work up. When I queue it to a
workqueue however, that latency jumps to ~30ms (average).

My current theory is that this latency interferes with the ability to
batch up requests to the disks and that is what accounts for the massive
slowdown.

So, I have several goals here in posting this:

1) to get some early feedback on this code. Does this seem reasonable,
assuming that we can address the workqueue latency problems?

2) get some insight about the latency from those with a better
understanding of the CMWQ code. Any thoughts as to why we might be
seeing such high latency here? Any ideas of what we can do about it?

3) I'm also cc'ing Al due to some changes in patch #10 to allow nfsd
to manage its fs_structs a little differently. Does that approach seem
reasonable?
