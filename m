FWIW, you could Cc me but you couldn't add 'Reviewed-by' here because in
first version I give a comment to you, and I don't think the patch looks
good to me at that time.  So please do not add 'Reviewed-by'.  I paste a
description about 'Reviewed-by' from Documentation/SubmittingPatches for
you information:

Reviewed-by:, instead, indicates that the patch has been reviewed and found
acceptable according to the Reviewer's Statement:

	Reviewer's statement of oversight

	By offering my Reviewed-by: tag, I state that:

 	 (a) I have carried out a technical review of this patch to
	     evaluate its appropriateness and readiness for inclusion into
	     the mainline kernel.

	 (b) Any problems, concerns, or questions relating to the patch
	     have been communicated back to the submitter.  I am satisfied
	     with the submitter's response to my comments.

	 (c) While there may be things that could be improved with this
	     submission, I believe that it is, at this time, (1) a
	     worthwhile modification to the kernel, and (2) free of known
	     issues which would argue against its inclusion.

	 (d) While I have reviewed the patch and believe it to be sound, I
	     do not (unless explicitly stated elsewhere) make any
	     warranties or guarantees that it will achieve its stated
	     purpose or function properly in any given situation.

A Reviewed-by tag is a statement of opinion that the patch is an
appropriate modification of the kernel without any remaining serious
technical issues.  Any interested reviewer (who has done the work) can
offer a Reviewed-by tag for a patch.  This tag serves to give credit to
reviewers and to inform maintainers of the degree of review which has been
done on the patch.  Reviewed-by: tags, when supplied by reviewers known to
understand the subject area and to perform thorough reviews, will normally
increase the likelihood of your patch getting into the kernel.

Otherwise the patch looks good to me.  You can add:
Reviewed-by: Zheng Liu <wenqing.lz@taobao.com>

As far as I understand, you are right.  We couldn't avoid this race
condition with punching hole.  Please correct me if I miss something.

'data=ordered' mode means that when we try to commit metadata, we must
make sure that related data has been written out on disk, but
'data=writeback' mode doesn't guarantee this.  So when we got a power
failure, we could read stale data with 'data=writeback' mode.

No, a overwriting write means that metadata has been allocated.  So we
don't need to allocate some blocks for these data.  That means that we
don't need to worry about the corrupted metadata.

One tip: you can write your question here in a patch.  When maintainer
apply your patch, your question will be ignored automatically.
Otherwise maintainer will change your commit log manually.
