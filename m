Some did that at least in ATA.  It was mapping some command to
firmware write.  Given how many USB devices implement SCSI these days,
I wouldn't be too firm with "that doesn't happen".  How can such
all-covering statement be asserted?

ISTR recycle.  Maybe it was ATA too and SCSI people are better.  I
don't know.

I have to say that's an overly optimistic view of the world.  There
are even devices puking on receiving SCSI commands in a slightly
different sequence than windows sends them out and devices which lock
up if you send them enough TURs.

You would get -EPERM/ACCES whatnot from base OS and you would know the
command in use, no?

Thanks.
