You're right -- I missed the complexity here.

To summarize, the previous discussion offered four possible solutions,
of which two were thought good:

b. Use Andreas's encoding, which is incompatible with pre-1970 files
written on 64-bit systems.

c. Use an encoding which is compatible with all pre-1970 files, but
incompatible with 64-bit post-2038 files, and which encodes a smaller
range of time and is more complicated. 

-------
I don't care about currently-existing post-2038 files, because I believe
that nobody has a valid reason to have such files.  However, I do
believe that pre-1970 files are probably important to someone.

Despite this, I prefer option (b), because I think the simplicity is
valuable, and because I hate to give up date ranges (even ones that I
think we'll "never" need). Option (b) is not actually lossy, because we
could correct pre-1970 files with e2fsck; under Andreas's encoding,
their dates would be in the far future (and thus cannot be legitimate).

Would a patch that does (b) be accepted?  I would accompany it with a
patch to e2fsck (which I assume would also go to the ext4 developers
mailing list?).
