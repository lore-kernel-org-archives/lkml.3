No I'm not, I said "now might be the time to ask which are the remaining
architectures that cannot do SG chaining" I think it's time to list them
so we know what work remains.  I know we've got a bunch in parisc (all
of our iommu code in driver/parisc - about 5 different ones - are
unconverted).  However, the conversion is pretty simple; it's mostly
replacing sglist++ with sglist=sg_next(sglist)

OK, so lets see what the actual effort is.
