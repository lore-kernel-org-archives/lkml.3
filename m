This should not be a problem with Ceph as the MDS (the metadata
server) hands out cache capability bit for an inode. In this schema
there's no need to worry about the count of of local file pointers
open for write (or even across the cluster).

As an aside, the Ceph code checks if we can perform the requested VMA
operation by checking the valid_fscache generation (compared to the
current cache generation). This way we only create the cookie the
first time the file is open. This has greatly simplified the code and
got rid of a lot of races.

Best,
- Milosz
