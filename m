On second thought, it appears I was a bit to hasty with this, and this patch actually breaks things.

No, it shouldn't oops because pos won't be NULL, &pos->field will be.

pos is only assigned via an rb_entry(rb_first_postorder()) or rb_entry(rb_next_postorder()). rb_next_postorder() and rb_first_postorder() can return NULL. That NULL then is munged by rb_entry to be (NULL - offset_of_field). Causing (&pos->field == NULL == (pos + offset_of_field)).

That is, unless I've screwed something up (very possible, as this overly hurried patchset shows).

I expect it's more likely that my adaptation of this to ext3's usage is buggy. Could you tell me what you did to cause the oops? And/Or post it?
