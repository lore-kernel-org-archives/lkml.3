I don't see a security implication, but we can fight over whether
seccomp performance or perf self monitoring performance is more
important.  I spent a bunch of time making seccomp *much* faster for
3.18, and things like Chromium (the browser) could have lots of
context switched into and out of seccomp. :)

I suspect that the overhead only really matters when running as a VM guest.

Hmm.  Can we switch lazily?  I don't really like the idea, but
non-seccomp, non-perf-event tasks could, in principle, just inherit
the PCE value from whatever had the CPU last.

Can you open a perf_event fd, fork, and mmap it in the child?  What if
you map it in the parent and the child?  Then cap_user_rdpmc has to
match for both mappings.  Or is this impossible?
