This patchset removes 100+ lines of code. Furthermore, I wouldn't 
characterize it as extending locks, so much as putting locks where they 
should've always been. The fact that device_list[foo] is never null 
means we've avoided crashes but not potentially incorrect accesses.

I assume this set would spend time in your tree, followed by Linus' tree 
before making it into a release. Also, any logic errors are likely to 
result in a fault, so they should not remain hidden for long.

Yes it does reduce wasted memory, that should be reason enough I'd say. 
But this patchset is also a building block for further improvements that 
are more significant. This set transitions all lun and mappedlun checks 
from checking a flag to checking for NULL. This is necessary before we 
can improve from a fixed-size array to more size-scalable data 
structures like a radix tree, or lockless, with RCU.

This is only an option for embedded. We should scale the amount of 
memory we use with the number of allocated LUNs and mapped LUNs.

See above about pointers vs flags, this is a first step toward more 
performant *and* space-efficient data structures.

I've pushed this patchset to

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/grover/linux.git

on two branches against your and Linus' repos:
against-linus
against-target-pending-for-next

(looked-over and compile-tested)

For your convenience.
