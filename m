Come on, now, Lennart.  You put a lot of words in my mouth.

I didn't say it wasn't.  I said that we can build a common substrate
that systemd can build on *and* non-systemd systems can use *and*
Google can participate in.

I forgot about the tautology of systemd.  systemd is monolithic.
Therefore it can not have any external dependencies.  Therefore it
must absorb anything it depends on.  Therefore systemd continues to
grow in size and scope.  Up next: systemd manages your X sessions!

But that's not my point.  It seems pretty easy to make this cgroup
management (in "native mode") a library that can have either a thin
veneer of a main() function, while also being usable by systemd.  The
point is to solve all of the problems ONCE.  I'm trying to make the
case that systemd itself should be focusing on features and policies
and awesome APIs.

Fewer and simpler are not compatible, unless you are losing
functionality.  Systemd is fewer, but NOT simpler.

Considering this is all hypothetical, I find this to be a funny
debate.  My hypothetical idea is better than your hypothetical idea.

Whoah, don't get defensive.  I said nothing of the sort.  The fact of
the matter is that we do not run systemd, at least in part because of
the monolithic nature.  That's unlikely to change in this timescale.
What I said was that it would be a shame if we had to invent our own
low-level cgroup daemon just because the "upstream" daemons was too
tightly coupled with systemd.

I think we have a lot of experience to offer to this project, and a
vested interest in seeing it done well.  But if it is purely
targetting systemd, we have little incentive to devote resources to
it.

Please note that I am strictly talking about the lowest layer of the
API.  Just the thing that guards cgroupfs against mere mortals.  The
higher layers - where abstractions exist, that are actually USEFUL to
end users - are not really in scope right now.  We already have our
own higher level APIs.

This is supposed to be collaborative, not combative.
