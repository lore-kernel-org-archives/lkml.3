Can you elaborate?  It seems entirely plausible to me that there are
programs that won't work right as PID 1 without considerable
adaptation.

pid namespaces also won't work in the context of Capsicum unless you
want every single Capsicum process to be its own pid namespace.  Also,
pid namespaces don't offer any way to protect children from parents.
