Given the convolute mess that the splice code already is I'd rather
prefer not overloading it even further.

Instead I'd make the sendfile code path that already works different
in practice separate first, and then generalize it to a copy chunk
syscall using the same code path.

We can still fall back to the splice code as a fallback if no option
is provided as a last resort, but I think making the splice code handle
even more totally different cases is the wrong direction.
