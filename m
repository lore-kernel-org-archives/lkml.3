Hi Linus,

Can you please pull the current XFS updates from the tree below?
The changes outlined in the tag description include everything that
is not in your tree, but I has a question about that because there
are commits in the branch that are already in your tree.

i.e. I have generated this pull-req from the base tree I've been working
on (3.17-rc2) but there have already been commits merged into a more
recent upstream tree (3.17-rc4) in this tree. When I generate the
pull request from the underlying 3.17-rc2 branch, it includes all
those commits, both in the summary and the diffstat. If I base the
pull request off 3.17, the base commit is the last one that was
merged into your tree, and the diffstat and commit list reflect
that.

So my question is this: Which tree should I generate the pull
request from? I flipped a coin an generated this one from 3.17-rc2,
but if you'd prefer to see just the commits/diffstat that aren't in
your tree, let me know and I'll do it differently next time....

-Dave.
