Hi Eric,

Well, in that particular case the flaw is in the programs that don't
handle setuid and its cousins correctly. IMHO this is a different case,
our concerns here are external suid-exec programs.

A sort of revoke or file handle invalidating on exec is already used as
the close-on-exec flag.

Ok, thanks

Ok, can you provide a link please? thanks

Please see below for a small PoC to test what you suggest Eric

So we embed a f_cred inside a seq_file struct and set it at seq_open()
We can also remove that 'user_ns' that is embedded in seq_file sruct
since we'll have it inside the f_cred! 


I've added a proc_may_access() function that will check the f_cred of
the opener against the target at read time, I've done this for:
1) the reader at open time may have enough permissions
2) reader does a suid-exec or change its ruid/euid
3) suid-exec or same reader with new privileged creds reads data

This is a legitimate scenario which I didn't want to block, so the fd
still can be passed but you will be able to read from it only if you
pass a) the classic ptrace check b) the check of f_cred against the
target.

IMO it's better than: check only if the cred of the process changes.


Since this is just a PoC for /proc/*/stack, I'll do more test, improve
it and send it as a series, thanks!

Any comment is welcome
