I'm afraid to say that I can't expose the device name because I've not 
confirmed yet that
the device is responsible for the problem with the device manufacturer. 
However, with the
limited evidence, It seems that SCSI command retried with UNIT_ATTENTION.

In the previous thread, Ewan reported that a storage array returned a 
CHECK_CONDITION
with invalid sense data, which caused the command to be retried 
indefinitely:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/8/20/498

So, we should try to avoid infinite retry in SCSI middle layer, not in 
each SCSI LLDD.

Sounds good!
Thanks for much simpler code. It's enough to fix the bug.
I'll resend the patch soon with the above code.
