Like you do today with any kernel feature that any userspace code relies
on, there's nothing new here that we haven't delt with for the past 20
years.

I don't think I understand what you mean by "portable", please define it
better.

s/kdbusfs/fuse/ if you want to make the same argument.  Sure, any kernel
feature comes with additional code and the normal worries about security
issues.  Being afraid of ever adding new features or code just because
_maybe_ there could be a problem there is a sure way to kill an entire
project.  A non-changing operating system is a dead operating system.

Lots of programs that previously ran on QNX have been ported to Linux
for a huge range of products (automotive has a bunch of these if you are
curious to look at them.)

"good software design" is in the eye of the beholder.

Nothing, userspace programs are already doing that, but memfds are not
the be-all-end-all, and actually are much slower for a large majority of
"normal" message sizes.

See the documentation for what can be attached, and yes, userspace can
not get access to lots of these things in a way that can not be
"spoofed", making the metadata pointless.

It's one of many things, as this list shows.

See above for why you can't use a memfd for "everything", you will slow
things down from what you have today if you were to attempt it.

To allow the existing applications in the initramfs from having to
roll-their-own form of IPC like they have had to do so today.  Also it
allows a much easier way to transition out of the initramfs than we have
today.
