You're right. I needed a different SW type in one of my early
prototypes, but it's not the case any more. Consider it gone.

Fine with me. If no one objects, I'm more than happy to use
PERF_RECORD_UEVENT = 11 for it.

Are you saying to drop even the "type 0 means zero-terminated string"
definition, even if everything else is up to the user? I quite like that
idea, especially combined with write()ing to the perf_fd (it is very
much like trace_marker then, which is beautiful in its simplicity), but
the feelings are not that strong to fight a war over it.
