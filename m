It seems it should be hashed in f_ops->atomic_open() (at least cifs
and nfs do it this way). In do_last when we do an ordinary open, we
don't hit parent i_mutex if lookup is succeeded through lookup_fast.
lookup_fast can catch newly created dentry and set it's share mode
before atomic_open codepath hits deny_lock_file.

Also, I noted that: atomic open does f_ops->atomic_open and then it
processes may_open check; if may_open fails, the file is closed and
open returns with a error code (but file is created anyway) . I think
there is no difference between this case and the situation with
deny_lock_file there.
