I tend to agree Tejun's opinion POV maintain and I don't have a number
of memcg static/dynamic effect for embedded side so I don't want to argue now.
AFAIRC, Mel reported last year that memcg had rather no small runtime effect
and some memcg guys are trying to solve it. The memcg guy among Cced guys of
this thread could answer that more clearly.

I don't care whatever API looks like. Of course, keeping the API the same is
always good if we decide to need it. The my point is that you have a plan
to support? Why I have a question is that you said your goal is to replace
lowmemory killer but android don't have enabled CONFIG_MEMCG as you know well
so they should enable it for using just notifier? or they need another hack to
connect notifier to global thing?

What's the plan?
