Yes.  You can't see keys in another namespace.  I occasionally wonder if I
should make the key serial number tree per namespace so that you don't search
keys outside your namespace and can't try looking them up by ID - but it
complicates the garbage collector which iterates over the entire tree (though
it could maintain a list of per-ns trees).

Root can do that anyway with file-based ccaches, I believe.  However, you can
change the key permissions to prevent root even seeing that your keys/keyrings
exist, let alone stealing them.
