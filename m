I wasn't trying to say XFS fixes your problem, but that we could
implement appending AIO writes in XFS fairly easily.

To verify Jan's theory, can you try to preallocate the file to the full
size and then run the benchmark by doing a:

# fallocate -l <size> <filename>

and then run it?  If that's indeed the issue I'd be happy to implement
the "real aio" append support for you as well.
