If you rely on this, then please fix this comment in fs/exec.c:

/*
 * determine how safe it is to execute the proposed program
 * - the caller must hold ->cred_guard_mutex to protect against
 *   PTRACE_ATTACH
 */
static void check_unsafe_exec(struct linux_binprm *bprm)

It sounds like cred_guard_mutex is there for exactly this reason  :)
