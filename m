Unfortunately that's not true in SCSI land, where most driver do per-lun
tagging, and the the cmd_per_lun values are very low and very often
single digits, as a simple grep for cmd_per_lun will tell.  Now it might
be that the tag space actually is much bigger in the hardware and the
driver authors for some reason want to limit the number of outstanding
commands, but the interface to the drivers doesn't allow them to express
such a difference at the moment.

Agreed, punting this to the drivers is a bad idea.  But at least
exposing variable for the allowed tag space and allowed outstanding
commands to be able to make a smarter decision might be a good idea.  On
the other hand this will require us to count the outstanding commands
again, introducing more cachelines touched than nessecary.  To make
things worse for complex topologies like SCSI we might have to limit the
outstanding commands at up to three levels in the hierarchy.
