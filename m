There's a certain amount of overlap with the aio/O_DIRECT work as well.
But if it's not a general session, could always be a BOF or something.

I'll second the argument that most technical topics probably DO belong
in a topic related workshop. But that leaves us with basically only
process related topics at KS, I don't think it hurts to have a bit of
tech meat on the bone too. At least I personally miss that part of KS
from years gone by.
