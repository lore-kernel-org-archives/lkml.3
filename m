You're right, I forgot that check.

And, sorry, I did miss that you said "non-directory".  But I think you
have that backwards: d_splice_alias looks like:

	if (inode && S_ISDIR(inode->i_mode)) {
		...
	} else {
		d_instantiate(dentry, inode);
		if (d_unhashed(dentry))
			d_rehash(dentry);
	}

So it ignores any existing aliases in the non-directory case.

d_materialise_unique by contrast calls __d_instantiate_unique, which
looks like it should avoid adding duplicates.

So I think switching everyone to d_materialiase_unique would result in
fewer dentries.  But I've never seen any complaint about the issue and
like you don't see a reason this would matter much either way.
