I think the right fix is to factor out a helper like:

static void sd_set_flush_flag(struct scsi_disk *sdkp)
{
	unsigned flush = 0;

	if (sdkp->WCE) {
		flush |= REQ_FLUSH;
		if (sdkp->DPOFUA)
			flush |= REQ_FUA;
	}

	blk_queue_flush(sdkp->disk->queue, flush);
}

which can be called from sd_revalidate_disk and cache_type_store.

If the user overrides the cache type he should expect data not to be
flushed, so I don't really think this is na issue.  Even if it is it
should be a separate issue as it already exists before your patch.
