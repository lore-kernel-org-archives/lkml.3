Fixed.

Fixed.

Done cleanup.

Fixed.

Yeah, it was supposed to be an optimization (no need to check for whiteouts on
lower, since whiteouts never exist on lower) and is present in the lookup code
as well.

I switched to checking whiteouts in lowest layer as well, for consitency.

It really doesn't make sense to make upper layer an overlayfs.  It won't work,
but it shouldn't crash.  Should we blacklist it, so any such stupidity is found
out at mount time?

Fixes pushed to

Thanks,
