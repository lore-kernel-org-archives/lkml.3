They don't touch each other.

Yes, a deny mode is associated with file descriptor - so, it will
conflict with any other access/deny modes of file descriptors from any
process.

The proposed patchset doesn't allow to change deny modes after an open
is done. But we can add a functionality to let flock syscall change
deny modes as on option.
