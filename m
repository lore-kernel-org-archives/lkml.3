Neither patch 3/6 nor 4/6 changes the syscall interface.

Patch 3/6 adds /proc/<pid>/ns/ entries, which looks more like #16 in
that document (for which /proc/<pid>/ns/<nstype> was never added).

Patch 4/6 adds internel kernel symbols which are never exposed to the
user.

Perhaps "expose" was the wrong word to use in the patch description.
This usage implies that it is no longer labelled "static" in its source
files to be able to expose that interface to other internal kernel
subsystems.
