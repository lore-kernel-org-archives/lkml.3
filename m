Is there any reason why the error message couldn't be simplified, to
something as "kernel symbol not found"?  I wasn't sure if the problem
was that there was some incompatibility between a recent change with
kprobe and systemtap, or parse failure in the systemtap script, etc.

If the goal is ease of use, I suspect the more important thing that
systemtap could do is to make its error messages more easily
understandable, instead of pointing the user to read a man page where
the user then has to figure out which one of a number of failure
scenarios were caused by a particularly opaque error message.  (The
man page doesn't even say that "semantic error while resolving probe
point" means that a kernel function doesn't exist -- especially
complaining about the kprobe identifier points the user in the wrong
direction.)
