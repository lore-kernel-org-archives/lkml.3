(re-adding back the cc lists...)

It'd be tricky, especially if you want to do it at runtime. The
procfile itself is not a problem per-se. The real problem is the
tracking you have to do in order to eventually present the procfile. So
a boot-time or compile-time switch might be reasonable, but a runtime
switch will probably never really be.

I have a new patchset that I'm testing now though that should address
Bruce's concerns about iterating over that global list. So far, it
seems to be at least as fast as the latest patchset I posted.

It makes the (spin)locking a bit more complex, but hopefully I can
document this well enough that it's not a great concern.

Stay tuned...
