I have included a patch with an explanation (the patch is against
tytso/dev -- I hope that's the correct place).

They were actually correct according to my patch's encoding (that is, my
patch used the existing encoding).  The existing encoding was written
correctly, but read wrongly.  As you say, this should not matter, since
nobody should be writing these timestamps, but I assumed that the
existing encoding had happened for a reason, and wanted to make the
minimal change.

If you believe it is important, I would be happy to change it.

I tested by using touch -d to create one file in each year between 1902
and 2446.  Then I unmounted and remounted the FS, and did ls -l and
manually verified that each file's date matched its name.

I think the idea of this is that it is the bottom 34 bits of the 64-bit
signed time.  However, it occurs to me that this relies on a two's
complement machine.  Even though the C standard does not guarantee this,
I believe the kernel requires it, so that's probably OK.

Patch follows:

--
Add a comment explaining the encoding of ext4's extra {a,c,m}time
bits.
