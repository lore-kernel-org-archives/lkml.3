Yes, I obviously thought about the same change ;)

But note that mpt_detach() doesn't look correct too. This is almost
off-topic, but still...

At least it needs s/cancel_delayed_work/cancel_delayed_work_sync/ to
sync with mpt_fault_reset_work().

And it is not clear if it is safe to simply destroy ->fw_event_q,
perhaps it can't have the pending works if the caller is teardown
path, and otherwise we rely on mptsas_cleanup_fw_event_q(), I do
not know... but mptsas_cleanup_fw_event_q() needs _sync too I guess,
and obviously mptsas_free_fw_event() should be called unconditionally.

OTOH, mpt_attach() doesn't verify that ->fw_event_q was created
succesfully. And, if mpt_do_ioc_recovery() fails it destroys
->reset_work_q but not ->fw_event_q. Looks like this driver needs
some cleanups.

scsi_host_alloc ;)

Yes, I think this is correct. mpt_attach() does kzalloc(MPT_ADAPTER) so
we can probably rely on ->sh == NULL if _alloc failed.

Oleg.
