Are you sure about this? I fail to see how they can be same as THP
allocations/charges are __GFP_NORETRY so there is only one reclaim
round for the hard limit reclaim followed by the charge failure if
it is not successful.

Wouldn't it help to simply fail the charge and allow the charger to
fallback for THP allocations if the usage is above high limit too
much? The follow up single page charge fallback would be still
throttled.

Agreed and I would expect those _facts_ to be part of the changelog.
