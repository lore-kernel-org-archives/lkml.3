Why do you say they don't guarantee anything? We ensure that we always
run on the cpus in our cpuset which are online. We do not run in any
arbitrary cpuset. We also do not wait unreasonably on an offline cpu to
come back. What we are doing is ensuring that if the resources that we
began with are available we use them. Why is this not a logical thing to
expect?

Which is? As I understand cpusets are meant to ensure a dedicated set of
resources to some tasks. We cannot scheduler the tasks anywhere outside
this set as long as they are available. And when they are not, currently
we move them to their parents, but you had also suggested killing the
task. Maybe this can be debated. But what behavior are we changing by
ensuring that we retain our original configuration at all times?

SMT 8 on Power8 can help/hinder workloads. Hence we dynamically switch
the modes at runtime.
