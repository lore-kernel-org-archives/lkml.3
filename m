Sorry I was wrong here. I find that the above dmesg is for commit
4830363 which is a merge HEAD that contains the cgroup code.

The dmesg for commit 878a876b2e1 ("Merge branch 'for-linus' of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mason/linux-btrfs")
looks different, which hangs after the tsc line:

Yes - I may do random merges and boot test the resulted kernels.

Thanks,
