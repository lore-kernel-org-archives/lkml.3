Later on I rebooted and ran smarctl:

# smartctl --test=long /dev/sdb 

As of now after two days I have:

# smartctl -a /dev/sdb

Aha, that was wrong. I thought it happened that kernel ran out of some buffers because
I used shell redirect to write into a file and the buffer just kept growing once the disk
was not accessible. But sure, teh first question is why it was not accessible.

How can I check? I just did mount without any arguments.

I don't think it was going to sleep. I was reading data from it. I suspect that
it was the ACPI which messed in due to that battery/ac power change. No, there
was no power outage.
