Any filesystem uses kernel, doesn't it?  Notionally, however, they
don't.  And notionally tmpfs is not about using memory but about being
non-persistent.  This is important because tmpfs *is* subject to
swapping and that does create security problems (you should want to
encrypt swap).

There's a difference between "notionally not persistent across
reboots" and "notionally stored in the kernel's address space".  The
real question is: why do you want the latter?

Some people have argued (not in this thread, and not recently on this
list) that credentials should be stored in the kernel and not leave it
(i.e., you shouldn't be able to extract them from the kernel).  This
implies a number of things, but one of those is a bad thing: unbounded
kernel credential caches OR LRU/LFU cache eviction.  Some of us rely
on caching to keep latency predictable, so cache eviction could be a
bit rough.  Unbounded kernel credential caches not subject to paging
are a DoS.  Unbounded-but-paged cred caches would be fine, but really,
what's the difference vis-a-vis FILE ccaches in /tmp?  The answer
depends on whether you allow the creds to leave kernel space.

That brings us to: what do we really want?  If we really want users to
not be able to see their tickets' session keys, then we don't need to
store their tickets in kernel land and we don't need to put
krb5_mk_req*() in the kernel either: we need only *wrap* the keys to
that low-level crypto use of those keys happens in the kernel and the
only thing the kernel stores is the wrapping key.  You might even have
a TPM or similar crypto decelerator handle this.

ISTM that a new ccache type whose purpose is to defeat the tmpfs race
conditions of the FILE ccache is a good thing.  I would prefer it to
be *portable*, and it could be, but keyring stuff isn't.  And FILE
ccache remains the lowest common denominator, so there's that too.
And since I've been dealing with some FILE ccache race conditions (see
new thread I'll start next), I think a) I hate FILE ccaches, b) I
don't see how to avoid having them.

Please make sure to have a cache eviction policy...  I don't know what
is "small" when it comes to Kerberos credentials either.  If the
difference between small and large is "lacks / has PAC and/or CAMMAC"
then you'll find that this difference mostly depends on the
environment, and generally your items will be either all "small" or
all large.  Are you building dead code?

Sure; why the ambivalence smiley?
