Hi Matthew,
I'm wondering where the 2.5us latency cut comes from. I did a simple test. In
my xeon 3.4G CPU, one cpu can do about 2M/s context switch of applications.
Assuming switching to idle is faster, so switching to idle and back should take
less than 1us. Does the 2.5us latency cut mostly come from deep idle state
latency? if so, maybe set a lower pm_qos value or have a better idle governer
to prevent cpu entering deep idle state can help too.

Thanks,
Shaohua
