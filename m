Guys,

Please read what I wrote.

The 2 GB limit is for the *virtual* mapping.

The *physical* mapping, where it lands in RAM, is completely
independent, and if you're going to randomize the latter, there is no
reason it has to match the former.  Instead, randomize it freely.

That is different from the i386 kernel which runs at its
physical-mapping address.

Incidentally, for performance reasons please avoid locating the kernel
below CONFIG_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS if possible.

Also make sure your code works with more than 128 e820 entries.
