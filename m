I don't understand that one.  Having a preforked thread with the proper
environment that can act like kthreadd in terms of spawning user mode
helpers works and is simple.  The only downside I can see is that there
is extra overhead.

Beyond that though for the user mode helpers spawned to populate
security keys it is not clear which context they should be run in,
even if we do have kernel threads.

You are correct it can not be assumed that what is visible in one mount
namespace is visible in another.  And of course in addition to picking
the correct binary to run you have to set up a proper environment for
that binary to run in.  It may be that it's configuration file is only
avaiable at the expected location in the proper mount namespace, even
if the binary is available in all of the mount namespaces.
