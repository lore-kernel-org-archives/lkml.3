yeah. it is messy, I tried to go for the least invasive changes.

I took the '>' test from the original while loop '>='. The original 
behavior
guaranteed bio->bi_phys_segments <= max_segments, if the bio satisfied
this condition to begin with.
I did not find any guarantees that the 'bio' parameter of this function 
has
to satisfy this condition in general.

My understanding is that if a caller of this function (or one of the 
two that call this one)
provides an invalid (segment-count-wise) bio, it will fail (return 0 
added length),
and let the caller handle the situation.
I admit, I did not check all the call paths that use these functions.

ah, yes. I guess I need a check that follows __blk_recalc_rq_segments 
more closely.
We know that at this point all pages are merged into segments, so a 
helper function that would be used
by both  __blk_recalc_rq_segments and this check is possible.


I still assume that a temporary increase of bi_phys_segments above 
max_segments is ok.
If we want to avoid this situation we would need to merge tail pages 
right away. That's imo uglier.
