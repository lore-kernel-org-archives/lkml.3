I applied all these with some tweaks to my pci/yijing-pci_is_pcie-v2
branch [1].  This will be rebased after v3.12-rc1, and may be amended
if any patches are picked up by others.

Hints (not just for you; I hope other people pay attention, too,
because I'm obsessive and I pay attention to these details):

  - Include a "[PATCH v2 0/6]" email.  That's a good place for you to
    put an overall description of the series, and a good place for
    responses like this one that apply to the whole series.

  - Pay attention to the order of your patches.  Yours seemed random,
    and I reordered them so the core PCI ones are first and the arch
    and driver ones are later.  That way I can easily drop the later
    ones if they are picked up by other maintainers.

  - Don't put "v1->v2" comments in your changelogs.  Those are fine
    in the "[0/6]" email, but they're useless in the git changelog, and
    I strip them out when I see them.  Or you can put them after the
    "---" line, in which case they get stripped out automatically.

  - Run "git log --oneline" on the files you touch.  You should follow
    the existing convention, including spacing, brackets, capitalization,
    etc.  I changed most of your subject lines for this reason.

  - Write titles that are sentences, starting with a verb, as suggested
    by Ingo [2].  You did this already; I just made changes for
    consistency of capitalization and the like.

  - Use real function names, not things like "pcie_capability_xxx".
    That makes it easier to search logs.

  - Be consistent about writing function names.  Some of your logs
    included, e.g., both "pci_bus_set_ops" and "dev_info()".  I prefer
    to always include the parentheses when writing a function name,
    but at least be consistent.

  - Don't put "Cc: <mailing-list>" in your changelog.  That tag is
    useful to show that a *person* has had the opportunity to comment
    on a patch but declined to do so.  I don't think it's meaningful
    for mailing lists.  If it were, every single commit would have
    that tag, since every single commit should appear on the relevant
    list.  I suspect you probably do this so that something like
    "git send-email --signed-off-by-cc" will automatically send mail
    to the right lists.  But that's a one-time convenience at the
    cost of useless info in the changelog that's there forever.

  - Put Signed-off-by, Acked-by, etc., tags in this order as suggested
    by Ingo [2]:

      Tested-by:
      Signed-off-by:

I think you meant to validate pcie_max_read_reqsz (the module parameter),
not max_rq.  I made this change on my branch.
