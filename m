I would like to see use of request_key() eventually so that the kernel can
fish a key directly out of the keyring if it needs one.  My kAFS filesystem
could pretty much use that immediately.

However, I don't really want to put all the Kerberos communications into the
kernel.  The keys obtained by request_key() on behalf of a filesystem might be
kerberos tickets or they might be something else.

It is true that a non-privileged user can store arbitrary keys in their
keyring and they could use it as an IPC mechanism if they really wanted to -
but if they could do that, they could use socketpairs, pipes or shm instead so
I'm not sure they can do anything that they couldn't do by some other
mechanism anyway.

Note that key accesses are regulated by the active LSM and I think can appear
in the audit log.
