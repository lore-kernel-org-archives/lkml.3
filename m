I do not follow the last point but that is not important.


For reasons that I listed in a private post I think
that my patch presented in this thread is closer to
our goals than your patch (2013/6/17/319). Timing is
important as well since we are approaching the lk 3.13
merge window. Regressions are what will set us back.


The remaining flaws are in the detach device area
which always seems to be the last one worked on,
probably because it is uncommon and the hardest :-)
My test code hasn't broken this area with my latest
patch (but that may be just luck or not good enough
test strategies).

Also the ULDs should get some basic guarantees from
the mid-level about the attach and remove/detach
device functions. I was thinking along the lines of
"called once and only once" per removed device; won't
overlap with an attach for the same device; may be
called from an interrupt context; should not wait,
etc.

Yes, you are correct I misread the above. That test can go
to the top of sg_open() without harm and make the critical
code sections easier to follow. IMO not a show stopper.
