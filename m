Hmm, had not considered that, but that will be a solution. That should also then pass the open("foo", O_CREAT | O_RDONLY, 0) case which certainly is better.

I'll be happy to test your patch.

Ok, switching hats to server...

If I am misinterpreting that paragraph, then I'm wondering what permission check the server should be doing. As far as I can tell, both Ganesha and knfsd are doing a permission check that matches my interpretation of the paragraph. If that's wrong, I'm happy to change the Ganesha implementation.
