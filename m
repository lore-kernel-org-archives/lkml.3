Agreed, there is no guarantee with how the hardware is designed.  We
don't have an instruction that can nuke RMID-tagged cachelines from the
cache, and the CPU guys (along with hpa) have been very explicit that
wbinv is not an option.

Exactly.  The cgroup grouping mechanisms fit really well with this
feature.  I was exploring another way to do it given the pushback on
using cgroups initially.  The RMID's won't be exposed, rather a group
identifier (in cgroups it's the new subdirectory in the subsystem), and
RMIDs are assigned by the kernel, completely hidden to userspace.

I assume this has been requested before.  As I'm typing this, I just
received the notification internally that the new SDM is now published.
I'll forward your request along and see what I hear back.

Yes please do look at the cgroup patches.  For the RMID allocation, we
could use your proposal to manage allocation/reclamation, and the
management interface to userspace will match the use cases I'm trying to
enable.

Understood now, I was missing the asynchronous point you were trying to
make.  I thought you wanted the free RMID to use that to always assign
so you know it's "empty," not to get around the twiddling that can
occur.

Let me know what you think about the cacheqos cgroup implementation I
sent, and if things don't look horrible, I can respin with your RMID
management scheme.

Thanks,
