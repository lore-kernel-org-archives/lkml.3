Ah, _that_ was the issue.
I was wondering why you kept on poking me ...

Well.
No, that's actually _not_ correct.
The correct fix would be

Thing is, we need to calculate the offset into the segment to figure out 
which map entry to use.
The actual number of the segment (as had been calculated with the 
original fix) is immaterial here.

Sorry for this. The email thread just flew past me during Xmas
with me not paying real attention.
