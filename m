The unit attention doesn't look like a problem, it
looks correct. If the system is unable to detect
removable media being changed while the system is
suspended, then ....

If the media has a unique identifier, then this unit
attention at wakeup should trigger sd to make sure
that unique identifier has not changed.

Not sure why ext4 starts looking at sdb6 _before_ the
sd driver processes that unit attention. Perhaps a
TEST UNIT READY should be done earlier in the wake-up
sequence to flush out (and process) unit attentions.
There is also the case in which the removable media is
no longer present; and that should change EXT4-fs
processing to a surprise removal.
