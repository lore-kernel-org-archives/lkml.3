  The patchset is trying to introduce hot tracking function in
VFS layer, which will keep track of real disk I/O in memory.
By it, you will easily know more details about disk I/O, and
then detect where disk I/O hot spots are. Also, specific FS
can take use of it to do accurate defragment, and hot relocation
support, etc.

  After V1 was sent out, Chandra Seetharaman has reviewed and
made a lot of comments, thanks a lot to him. Not it's time to
send out its V2 for external review, any comments or ideas are
appreciated, thanks.

NOTE:

  The patchset can be obtained via my kernel dev git on github:
git://github.com/wuzhy/kernel.git hot_tracking
  If you're interested, you can also review them via
https://github.com/wuzhy/kernel/commits/hot_tracking

Changelog from v1:
 - Refactored to be under RCU [Chandra Seetharaman]
 - Merged some code changes [Chandra Seetharaman]
 - Fixed some issues [Chandra Seetharaman]

v1:
 - Solved 64 bits inode number issue. [David Sterba]
 - Embed struct hot_type in struct file_system_type [Darrick J. Wong]
 - Cleanup Some issues [David Sterba]
 - Use a static hot debugfs root [Greg KH]

rfcv4:
 - Introduce hot func registering framework [Zhiyong]
 - Remove global variable for hot tracking [Zhiyong]
 - Add btrfs hot tracking support [Zhiyong]

rfcv3:
 1.) Rewritten debugfs support based seq_file operation. [Dave Chinner]
 2.) Refactored workqueue support. [Dave Chinner]
 3.) Turn some Micro into be tunable [Zhiyong, Liu Zheng]
       TIME_TO_KICK, and HEAT_UPDATE_DELAY
 4.) Cleanedup a lot of other issues [Dave Chinner]

rfcv2:
 1.) Converted to Radix trees, not RB-tree [Zhiyong, Dave Chinner]
 2.) Added memory shrinker [Dave Chinner]
 3.) Converted to one workqueue to update map info periodically [Dave Chinner]
 4.) Cleanedup a lot of other issues [Dave Chinner]

rfcv1:
 1.) Reduce new files and put all in fs/hot_tracking.[ch] [Dave Chinner]
 2.) The first three patches can probably just be flattened into one.
                                        [Marco Stornelli , Dave Chinner]
