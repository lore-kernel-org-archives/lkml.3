Yes, of course

Yes I do realize. That change was only to block leaks against already
running processes and *restore* the old permissions.

Yes Kees,

I did try a year ago to adapt the exec_id from grsecurity and failed
(and failed again to resend - not enough resources):
https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/3/10/174


Kees IMHO the right solution is to invalidate the fd across exec as
you suggest

Alan Cox's thread which describe the problem correctly:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/1/29/35

Alan suggested to revoke() the file handles.



So:
There are more of these /proc files with 0444 and without appropriate
ptrace protections that allow ASLR leaks, and doing 0400 will not
totally fix it, not to mention that 0400 on /proc/pid/maps can break
glibc, etc.


A solution would be to implement the per-cpu exec_id used in grsecurity
and also suggested here:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/3/11/23

grsecurity uses the current (reader) exec_id to track if this is still
the same reader. We can use the target exec_id instead of the reader to
bind all these files to their exec_id target task + ptrace checkes at
open(), read(), write()...

Can we consider this some sort of a revoke() for these special files?


Thanks
