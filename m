Ok, I'll not argue on f_cred or user_ns as fields for seq_file struct


Al there are other solutions:

1) Use the 'struct file' as pointed by Linus, but instead make
the seq_file->private member point to it.
These ONE nodes that share the same code call:
   proc_single_open()
     -> single_open(filp, proc_single_show, inode);
       -> seq_open()
       -> seq_file->private = inode;

So instead of 'inode' we can pass the 'struct file' to single_open(),
and get the 'inode' and 'file->f_cred' later at any point.

If we go for this, then later other files like /proc/*/{maps,smaps}
that use the 'struct proc_maps_private' should also embed a pointer
to the 'struct file' in that struct. These files use seq files and their
seq_file->private point to this 'struct proc_maps_private'.

So:
Sensitive ONE files can use this solution.
Sensitive INF files need to be converted to REG files and have their own
file operations, like it's done in
[PATCH 11/12] procfs: improve permission checks on /proc/*/syscall

Other REG files will receive the 'struct file' as an arugment, and for
files that use seq files, we should find a way to embed a pointer to
the 'struct file'.


2) Like (1) but instead of using the 'struct file' we pass the adress of
&file->f_inode. We can have 'struct file' using container_of and we also
have the inode. But it will just add more extra level of indirections.
I'm not sure of this one! I don't like it, what about other
/proc/<pid>/* files ? Is this consistent ?


3) Make the sensitive files like /proc/*/{stack,stat} have their own
file_operations. These are ONE nodes that share the same code with the
other ONE files.

I've already done this for /proc/*/syscall that shares code with other
INF files:
[PATCH 11/12] procfs: improve permission checks on /proc/*/syscall

That was the only way I found to have appropriate permission checks and
to not break other files. The /proc/<pid>/auxv will also need its own
file_operations.


We can also argue that sharing code is good or not as good as we think.
Example there is extra unused code for the /proc/*/stack
proc_pid_stack() handler. This function never use its 'pid and ns'
arguments, so why bother to retrieve them!


If we go for this (3) there will be:
* More extra code but optimized for the corresponding file.
* We should not touch seq_file struct.
* These files will still continue to use seq files.
* We'll embed a pointer to the 'struct file' inside
  'struct proc_maps_private', so we can protect /proc/<pid>/{maps,smaps}
  files later. They use seq files, the check will be implemented in
  their m_start() handler.


Personally I'll go for (3) since we'll do the same for some INF files.


Al, what do you think ?
