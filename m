The above commit was a follow-up to commit 71e75c97f97a, which did the following:

-       if (sdev->device_busy == 0 && !scsi_device_blocked(sdev))
+       if (atomic_read(&sdev->device_busy) && !scsi_device_blocked(sdev))

meaning it reversed the polarity of the check in the original code.
Since that commit created problems as observed in qemu, I thought it
would be obvious that restoring the original polarity would make sense.
This is explained in my patch, so I am somewhat at loss why ...

this question is asked.

Having said that, I don't really care one way or another. I am fine
with reverting my commit; if that is done, I'll simply remove the
related scsi tests from my qemu test runs.
