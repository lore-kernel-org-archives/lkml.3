Hi all,

First of all I couldn't reproduce this regression in my sand box.  So
the following speculation is only my guess.  I suspect that the commit
(ae4647fb) isn't root cause.  It just uncover a potential bug that has
been there for a long time.  I look at the code, and found two
suspicious stuff in jbd2.  The first one is in do_get_write_access().
In this function we forgot to lock bh state when we check b_jlist ==
BJ_Shadow.  I generate a patch to fix it, and I really think it is the
root cause.  Further, in __journal_remove_journal_head() we check
b_jlist == BJ_None.  But, when this function is called, bh state won't
be locked sometimes.  So I suspect this is why we hit a BUG in
jbd2_journal_put_journal_head().  But I don't have a good solution to
fix this until now because I don't know whether we need to lock bh state
here, or maybe we should remove this assertation.

So, generally, Tony, Eunbong, could you please try the following patch?

Thanks in advance,
                                                - Zheng


Subject: [PATCH] jbd2: lock bh state when check b_jlist == BJ_Shadow

From: Zheng Liu <wenqing.lz@taobao.com>

When we try to check b_jlist's value we need to lock bh state.  But in
do_get_write_access when we check b_jlist == BJ_Shadow we won't lock bh
state.  So fix it.
