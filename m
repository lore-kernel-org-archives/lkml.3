Please stop trying to drive the split wider, and attempting to make
yourself upstream for something that you did not create.

You are responsible for this fork (and associated headaches) to begin
with.  Now that we have, as promised, relicensed this code, the time has
come to do the right thing for the wider community and push your changes
upstream.

Please read the following:

https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Staying_close_to_upstream_projects

"The Fedora Project focuses, as much as possible, on not deviating from
upstream in the software it includes in the repository."

Don't you think this applies to you, too?

Because -fb has had close to zero peer review, and you've not solicited
much input (none from us) before making significant changes to
rtslib/targetcli over the past 1 1/2 years.

For your own private tree this wouldn't matter.  However, for a single
upstream tree moving forward, it seems irresponsible to just ask us to
sign off on every decision that you've made in -fb with little external
review or input.

So, to help us get back to a community development model, please cut a
-fb branch against upstream rtslib/configshell/targetcli, and start
sending the series out for public review.
