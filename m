  This won't quite work because if the page is fully mapped
mpage_process_page_bufs() will immediately submit the page and decrease
nr_to_write. So now you would end up writing less than you were asked for
in some cases. Attached patch should do what's needed. Can you try whether
it fixes the problem for you (it seems to work OK in my testing).

Subject: [PATCH] ext4: Fix performance regression in ext4_writepages()

Commit 4e7ea81db5(ext4: restructure writeback path) introduces another
performance regression on random write: The logic in
mpage_prepare_extent_to_map() always prepares at least one page for
mapping and the loop in ext4_writepages() doesn't terminate when
nr_to_write drops to zero if there is something to map. So we will still
try to write more that we should and we will do it in 1 page chunks.

Fix the problem by moving nr_to_write check in
mpage_prepare_extent_to_map() before preparing the first page. That way
mpage_prepare_extent_to_map() will return without preparing anything when
nr_to_write is exhausted and the loop in ext4_writepages() will be
terminated properly.
