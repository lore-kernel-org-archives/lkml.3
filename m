  It doesn't really relate to NR_WRITEBACK_TEMP. We have two dirty limits
in the VM - the global one and a per bdi one (which is a fraction of a
global one computed based on how much device has been writing back in the
past). Normally until we have more than (dirty_limit +
dirty_background_limit) / 2 dirty pages globally, the per bdi limit is
ignored. And BDI_CAP_STRICTLIMIT means that the per-bdi dirty limit is
always observed. Together with max_ratio and min_ratio this is useful for
limiting amount of dirty pages for specific bdis. And FUSE uses it so that
userspace filesystems cannot easily lockup the system by creating lots of
dirty pages which cannot be written back.

So I actually don't think BDI_CAP_STRICTLIMIT is a particularly good fit
for your problem although I agree with Rik that FUSE faces a similar
problem.
