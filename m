Umm.. without delving into details, aren't you basically creating a
memory cgroup inside a memory cgroup?  Doesn't sound like a
particularly well thought-out plan to me.

Seems kinda obvious.  Put it in a separate cgroup?  You're basically
saying it doesn't want to be under the same memory limit as the
processes that it's looking over.  That's like the definition of being
in a different cgroup.

Thanks.
