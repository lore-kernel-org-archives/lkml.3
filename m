Okay, Dave already answered.

Okay, I see.

Hi Ted.

If there is error in the middle of extent shifting, the hole will
present between the last shifted extent and the extent at which error
happen so this will be consistent state.
IMHO even if there is error in between the shift, filesystem will be
in consistent state.
Am I missing something?
