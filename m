yes - that was the session. Granted the posted notes were rather terse.

More of the ideas were presented in this recent email thread: 
http://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=136819142000596&w=2

In general - we're going to create a LLD library for error handling, 
using paradigms in libsas, that:
- no longer stops the whole host on the 1st error and doesn't start 
error handling till all outstanding io is finished/timedout
- sends per-io aborts immediately, and in parallel. LLD handlers will be 
asynchronous.
- no lun/target will be stopped until i/o aborts start to fail.
- do smart handling of lun resets, target resets, bus resets, etc and 
don't potentially do it for every i/o.

Several of these topics were touched on in the email thread.

the patches are being worked on now - hopefully to be posted as an RFC 
within the next couple of weeks.
