Creating a snapshot of an active swapfile would create shared extents,
so the next time we have to swap out a page, we'd have to do a COW,
which we're already trying pretty hard to avoid. We could allow it, but
it might lead to some unreliable behavior and unhappy emails to the
mailing list. However, I do see your point about wanting to avoid
special cases, so I'd like to get some more input from others on this as
well.

[snip]

That's my fault for not running with lockdep enabled. The problem here
is that swap-over-NFS is the only caller of nfs_direct_IO, so
nfs_direct_IO doesn't observe the normal direct_IO locking conventions
and neither does swap_writepage. I'll have to shuffle around some code
on the NFS side to fix that.

It looks like the non-btrfs parts of this might get a bit bigger, so
I'll look into getting that in separately.

Thanks!
