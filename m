3.4-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: "J. Bruce Fields" <bfields@redhat.com>

commit 365da4adebb1c012febf81019ad3dc5bb52e2a13 upstream.

This fixes a regression from 247500820ebd02ad87525db5d9b199e5b66f6636
"nfsd4: fix decoding of compounds across page boundaries".  The previous
code was correct: argp->pagelist is initialized in
nfs4svc_deocde_compoundargs to rqstp->rq_arg.pages, and is therefore a
pointer to the page *after* the page we are currently decoding.

The reason that patch nevertheless fixed a problem with decoding
compounds containing write was a bug in the write decoding introduced by
5a80a54d21c96590d013378d8c5f65f879451ab4 "nfsd4: reorganize write
decoding", after which write decoding no longer adhered to the rule that
argp->pagelist point to the next page.
