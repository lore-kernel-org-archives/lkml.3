It does a number of sort-of-related things.  Maybe it does them better
by doing them together.  I can't say, really.  We don't use it at
work, and I am on Ubuntu elsewhere, for now.

I'm really just talking about the most basic low-level substrate of
writing to cgroupfs.  Again, we don't use udev (yet?) so we don't have
these problems.  It seems to me that it's possible to formulate a
bottom layer that is usable by both systemd and non-systemd systems.
But, you know, maybe I am wrong and our internal universe is so much
simpler (and behind the times) than the rest of the world that
layering can work for us and not you.

Well, it SOUNDS like Serge is trying to develop this to demonstrate
that a standalone daemon works.  That's what I am keen to help with
(or else we have to invent ourselves).  I am not really afraid of IPC
or of "more daemons".  I much prefer simple agents doing one thing and
interacting with each other in simple ways.  But that's me.

Fair enough - I did not realize you had already done all the work that
Serge is just starting out on.

It is not a replacement for any one thing.  It is a replacement for a
handful of things that we are not keen to change all at once.  That's
all.  I have not personally looked at what subsystems are able to be
compiled-out so we could do an incremental changeover, though, so
maybe it can work in different modes?  I don't know.  I am not
pursuing this anyway, so I am not the person to convince, regardless.

Sorry, then.  No offense intended.  I'm just looking for opportunities
to not-replicate work, if this whole model is going to be thrust upon
me.
