After having a couple of good strong bourbons, It came to me about
15 minutes ago that I've had a case of forest, trees and bears
today. What I said above is most likely wrong and I think there's
probably a simple reason for the bug I'm seeing: xip_io() does
not handle the buffer_new(bh) case correctly. i.e. this case:


	  newly allocated buffer
	+-------------------------------+
	+-zero-+----user data----+-zero-+

i.e. it doesn't zero the partial head and tail of the block
correctly if the block has just been allocated. If the block has
just been allocated, get_block() is supposed to return the bh marked
as buffer_new() to indicate to the caller it needs to have regions
that aren't covered with data zeroed.

Yes, makes fsx run for more than 36 operations. But it only makes it
to 79 operations, and then....

# xfs_io -tf -c "truncate 18k" -c "pwrite 19k 21k" -c "pread -v 18k 2k" -c "bmap -vp" /mnt/scr/foo
....
EXT: FILE-OFFSET      BLOCK-RANGE      AG AG-OFFSET        TOTAL FLAGS
   0: [0..31]:         hole                                    32
   1: [32..39]:        120..127          0 (120..127)           8 10000
   2: [40..71]:        128..159          0 (128..159)          32 00000
   3: [72..79]:        216..223          0 (216..223)           8 00000

Ok, it's leaving an unwritten extent where it shouldn't be. That
explains the zeros instead of data. I'll look further at it in the
morning now I think I'm on the right track...

I don't think that's what I'm seeing. As it is, ext4 should not
be zeroing the block during unwritten extent conversion. This looks
to have been added
to make the xip_fault() path work, but I think it's wrong. What I
had to do for XFS in the xip_fault() path to ensure that we returned
allocated, zeroed blocks from xfs_get_blocks_xip() was:

	allocate as unwritten
	xip_clear_blocks
	mark extent as written

so that it behaves like the direct IO path in terms of the
"allocate, write data, mark unwritten" process. But for direct IO,
xip_io() needs to be doing the block zeroing in response to
get_blocks setting buffer_new(bh) after allocating the unwritten
extent. Then it can copy in the data and call endio to convert it to
written....

Cheers,

Dave.
