Idea was to trigger an OOM until we can migrate any particular process 
onto desired cgroup.

Well, this can be done it seems. Let me explore around this. Thanks for 
this suggestion.

Yes, this can be seen as a shortcut because we are off-loading some 
task-selection to be killed by OOM on kernel rather than userspace 
decides by itself.
