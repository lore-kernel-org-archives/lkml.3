Just FYI, my workflow involves using imap flags to tag stuff for actions
and then using a set of date sorted evolution search folders to
translate the flags into work queues.  The search folders are by flag
and thread, so a side effect of the way evolution does date ordering is
that it's ordered by the most recent last, so the date it takes for
thread ordering is the most recent email in the thread.  Originally, I
thought of this as an annyoing evolution bug because I wanted the folder
ordered by date of the patch submission.  However, later I came to
appreciate that it meant currently actively discussed patches moved down
in my workqueue automatically, so now I quite like it as a feature. It
does mean, however, that the net effect of sending very frequent pings
about a patch set is to cause that patch set to move down in my work
queue and, unfortunately, even coming from a domain that habitually
breaks threading doesn't save you because evolution helpfully has a set
of heuristic rules to rethread outlook breakage.
