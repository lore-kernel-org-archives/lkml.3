This, at least, doesn't have the problem with unprivileged processes
pinning themselves.

Why is its userns relevant?

Why not just check whether the target cgroup is in the process doing
the write's cgroupns? (NB: you need to check f_cred, here, not
current_cred(), but that's orthogonal.)  Then the policy becomes: no
user of cgroupfs can move any process outside of the cgroupfs's user's
cgroupns root.

I think I'm okay with this.

The empty string seems just as problematic to me.

I'm still unconvinced that this serves any purpose.  If you give
DAC/MAC permission to a task to write to something, and you give it
access to an fd or mount pointing there, and you don't want it writing
there, then *don't do that*.  I'm not really seeing why cgroupns needs
special treatment here.

Seems okay.

I think setns should completely ignore the caller's cgroup and should
not change it.  Userspace can do this.

Migration for processes in a mntns that have a current directory
outside their mntns is also difficult or impossible.  Same with
pidnses with an fd pointing at /proc/self from an outside-the-pid-ns
procfs.  Nothing new here.
