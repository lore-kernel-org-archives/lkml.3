You don't and that should work just as well, just slower. But since the
node id is in the futex 'value' we'll always end up in the right
node-hash, even if its a remote one.

So yes, per node hashes, and a persistent futex->node map.

And before people start talking about mempol and using that to bind
memory to nodes and such, remember that private futexes do not have a
vma lookup and therefore mempols are impossible to use.
