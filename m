Really, no.  We don't deliberately break old drivers to see if anyone
notices.  Usually the feedback loop is months to years for the long tail
to notice and by that time fixing the problem becomes a real pain if you
allow driver churn.

We keep old drivers that compile until there's a problem caused usually
by something like API changes.

The check can be fixed.  If you look at what Fengguang Wu does, he has a
list of expected problems which he diffs.  Don't churn the tree to match
the checker, make the checker match the tree.

Why would we care?  If it compiles that's fine, it's not causing a
problem and it might just be useful to somebody.

The time obsolete drivers cause problems is tree or subsystem wide API
changes.  Then we look at the amount of work required and sometimes
remove them or do hack fixes.

Try ide ... they have the same policy.

Try to understand the reason: we have a long tail of people using
obsolete systems who we try not to break.  Any change to an unmaintained
driver which can't be tested risks that ... and I'm the one who would
have to try to sort out the problem when it's noticed, hence the
caution.  If we allow trivial churn, by the time the breakage is noticed
(usually months to years later), the driver will have picked up a ton of
changes and finding the problem one becomes really hard.  So
unmaintained drivers get a default deep freeze maintenance policy.

Even for a maintained driver, if the maintainer has little access to the
hardware and few users they may also choose a deep freeze maintenance
policy for the same reasons above; that's why no changes without
maintainer ack.
