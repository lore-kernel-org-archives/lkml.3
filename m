First of all - thanks a lot!

I took Thor because we have exactly the same Thors in some of our
Solaris servers. I've also tried 6 different qlogics (mostly 8G) and
fnic (10G) as well. Surprisingly enough Thor was the fastest one for
seqwr 4k. Though in most of the cases machines were from our different
DCs and hence each one connected to yet another storage.

The strangest thing to me that this is the problem with sequential
write. For example the fnic one machine is zoned to EMC XtremIO and
had results: 14.43Mb/sec 3693.65 Requests/sec for sequential 4k. The
same fnic machine perfrormed rather impressive for random 4k
451.11Mb/sec 115485.02 Requests/sec
