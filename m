Hello, Linus.

A lot updates for cgroup.

* The biggest one is cgroup's conversion to kernfs.  cgroup took after
  the long abandoned vfs-entangled sysfs implementation and made it
  even more convoluted over time.  cgroup's internal objects were
  fused with vfs objects which also brought in vfs locking and object
  lifetime rules.  Naturally, there are places where vfs rules don't
  fit and nasty hacks, such as credential switching or lock dance
  interleaving inode mutex and cgroup_mutex with object serial number
  comparison thrown in to decide whether the operation is actually
  necessary, needed to be employed.

  After conversion to kernfs, internal object lifetime and locking
  rules are mostly isolated from vfs interactions allowing shedding of
  several nasty hacks and overall simplification.  This will also
  allow implmentation of operations which may affect multiple cgroups
  which weren't possible before as it would have required nesting
  i_mutexes.

* Various simplifications including dropping of module support, easier
  cgroup name/path handling, simplified cgroup file type handling and
  task_cg_lists optimization.

* Prepatory changes for the planned unified hierarchy, which is still
  a patchset away from being actually operational.  The dummy
  hierarchy is updated to serve as the default unified hierarchy.
  Controllers which aren't claimed by other hierarchies are associated
  with it, which BTW was what the dummy hierarchy was for anyway.

* Various fixes from Li and others.  This pull request includes some
  patches to add missing slab.h to various subsystems.  This was
  triggered xattr.h include removal from cgroup.h.  cgroup.h
  indirectly got included a lot of files which brought in xattr.h
  which brought in slab.h.

There are several merge commits - one to pull in kernfs updates
necessary for converting cgroup (already in upstream through
driver-core), others for interfering changes in the fixes branch.

Pulling in this branch creates four conflicts - two detected during
merge and two silent.

C1. e61734c55c24 ("cgroup: remove cgroup->name") dropped a bunch of
    vars from mem_cgroup_print_oom_info and 08088cb9ac0a ("memcg:
    change oom_info_lock to mutex") changed one of them.  Can be
    combined by dropping what's dropped in the former and updating
    oom_info_lock according to the latter.

void mem_cgroup_print_oom_info(struct mem_cgroup *memcg, struct task_struct *p)
{
<<<<<<< HEAD

	 * protects memcg_name and makes sure that parallel ooms do not
	 * interleave

	struct mem_cgroup *iter;
	unsigned int i;


C2. b8dadcb58d54 ("cpuset: use rcu_read_lock() to protect task_cs()")
    replaced task_lock() with rcu_read_lock() and 99afb0fd5f05
    ("cpuset: fix a race condition in
    __cpuset_node_allowed_softwall()") relocated a line into the
    locked region from after.  The resolution is straight-forward.

	return allowed;

	allowed = node_isset(node, cs->mems_allowed);
	rcu_read_unlock();

	mutex_unlock(&callback_mutex);
	return allowed;


C3. fed95bab8d29 ("sysfs: fix namespace refcnt leak") added an
    argument to kernfs_mount() and was routed through driver-core-next
    after cgroup pulled the tree.  cgroup's usage needs to be updated
    accordingly.


C4. 3eb59ec64fc7 ("cgroup: fix a failure path in create_css()") routed
    through cgroup/for-3.14-fixes added new usage of ss->subsys_id
    which was renamed to ss->id in the devel branch.  The new usage
    needs to be updated accordingly.


The following patch resolves C3 and C4.

Due to the intermediate merges, git-request-pull's diffstat didn't
match the changes made by pulling in the tree.  diffstat is generated
by comparing pre and post merge trees.  The test merge is available in
test-merge-3.15 branch.
