I don't think that we need to convert siginfo into a human readable format
in kernel. For example siginfo with a negative si_code contains binary data.
A kernel already has got signalfd_siginfo and we can see, that it's not
good.
I think would be better to print siginfo in a human readable format from
userspace (e.g. gdb) and implement a generic interface in kernel (e.g.
ptrace).
