We're talking about the server side here, not the client, so I'm not
sure what you mean by "nfs mounts".  The nfs server does use various
pseudofilesystems ("proc", "nfsd"), and those can be mounted outside the
initial network namespace.

The server can receive rpc requests over network interfaces outside the
initial network namespace, sure.  The server doesn't perform mounts on
behalf of clients, though, it just accesses previously mounted
filesystems on clients' behalf.

OK, so that's just a limitation on any mount whatsoever for now.  I'm
catching on, slowly, thanks!

Right, Stanislav's got 4 more patches that should finish the job; see
http://mid.gmane.org/<20130201125210.3257.46454.stgit@localhost.localdomain>
and followups.  That should make it for 3.9, I just need to review
them....

Yes.

There are a couple callback services on the NFS client--those should be
associated with nfs mounts in some obvious way.  There's a confusing ACL
service that's really just an appendage of NFSv2/v3 service.

I think we're fine.

I think you're right.

So for now it's safely confined to one user namespace, and I think we
understand approximately what to do if we want to support nfsd's in user
namespace in the future.  (Mainly, make sure nfsd and proc can be
mounted in them and then most things will be determined by the user_ns
of the network namespace associated with a given rpc.)

--b.
