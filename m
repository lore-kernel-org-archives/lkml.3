The AIM7 benchmark that I used runs a large number of relatively short 
jobs. I think each time a new job is spawned, the file mappngs have to 
be redone again. It is probably not a big problem for long running 
processes.

I had tried, but not yet able to run the MOSBench myself. Thank for 
letting me know that the dcache problem wrt MOSBench was fixed.

I will certainly hope so. However, there will still be a lot of 
computers out there running pre-Haswell Intel chips. For them, locking 
is still a problem that need to be solved.
