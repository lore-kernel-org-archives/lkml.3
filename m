So if I'm understanding correctly, the locks are held for bounded time
so under normal situation you don't really need to freeze here. But if
the task that is going to wake you were to freeze then this code path
could block suspend if PF_FREEZER_SKIP were not set.

For this particular case (not in general), instead of calling
try_to_freeze(), what if you only cleared PF_FREEZER_SKIP. For case
#1, you wouldn't block suspend if you're stuck waiting. If you
received the event while processes were freezing, you'd just
try_to_freeze() some place else. Probably on the way back up from the
system call. For case #4, you'd eventually complete the rpc and then
freeze some place else. If you're stuck waiting for the bit because
the process that was going to wake you also got frozen, then the
container would be stuck in the THAWING state. Not catastrophic and
something the administrator could workaround by sequencing things
right.

Does this sound like a reasonable workaround?
