I don't really distinguish between these two. The purpose of this 
paragraph is to show the best use cases for the spinning futexes is when 
the lock owner is not likely to sleep while in the critical section.

If we can improve the context switching overhead, that can certainly 
help a lot of applications.

Not really, this patch is to emulate the current behavior of the 
wait-wake futex which is queued in a priority queue. Because of 
spinning, tasks may enter into sleep state in different order than when 
they enter into the kernel. That is why I keep a sequence number to 
track who go into the kernel first.
