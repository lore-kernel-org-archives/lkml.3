Looks good,

One thing that came to mind after starring at this code for a while and
then seeing your cleanup:

the sleep/wake patterns in __break_lease seem highly suboptimal, as
we always wait for the break time on the first least found, why
don't we simply take the max of the lease break times, and wait for
that?

I guess the case of lots of read leases just isn't common enough to
bother..
