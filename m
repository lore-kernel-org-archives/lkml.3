Ok, noted.

Yes.

For the seq_file struct, yes we can make it point to the 'struct file'.

Or, I've also found other ways, perhaps they will make Al happy, one of
them is to use the 'struct file' as you point, but in an other way, or
change the file_operations of these sensitive files.
Please Linus see my next response to Al, thanks

Ok, will improve it.

Will also wait to see what others think, then resend as a V2

Thanks.
