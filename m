Um, I think you need to re-read the thread; that's not what I said at
all. It's even written lower down: "PA can't do atomic bit sets (no
atomic RMW except the ldcw operation) it can do atomic writes to
fundamental sizes (byte, short, int, long) provided gcc emits the
correct primitive".  The original question was whether atomicity
required native bus width access, which we currently assume, so there's
no extant problem.

What accommodation?  I was just explaining the architectural atomicity
rules on PA.  How they're bus dependent (which isn't a PA restriction)
and how the compiler can mess them up.  None of the current PA atomicity
rules conflicts with anything we do today ... the danger is that moving
to implicit atomicity gives us more scope for compiler problems ... but
that's not PA specific either; any architecture requiring alignment has
this problem.
