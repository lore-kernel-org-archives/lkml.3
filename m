Yes, and on this specific point I would like to understand why we
are adding yet more pci_sys_data data in the last series that is
already in -next:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/10/27/85

What does this buy us ? The cover letter says already that there *is*
a better solution, why do not we work on that instead of adding more churn
to arch specific code ?

Thanks,
Lorenzo
