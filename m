Subject: [PATCH v3 00/20] kselftest install target feature
Date: Wed, 24 Dec 2014 09:27:36 -0700

This patch series adds a new kselftest_install make target
to enable selftest install. When make kselftest_install is
run, selftests are installed on the system. A new install
target is added to selftests Makefile which will install
targets for the tests that are specified in INSTALL_TARGETS.
During install, a script is generated to run tests that are
installed. This script will be installed in the selftest install
directory. Individual test Makefiles are changed to add to the
script. This will allow new tests to add install and run test
commands to the generated kselftest script. kselftest target
now depends on kselftest_install and runs the generated kselftest
script to reduce duplicate work and for common look and feel when
running tests.

This approach leverages and extends the existing framework that
uses makefile targets to implement run_tests and adds install
target. This will scale well as new tests get added and makes
it easier for test writers to add install target at the same
time new test gets added.

This series is uploaded to the following experimental branch
for anybody that is interested in playing with it:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/shuah/linux-kselftest.git devel

Some benchmark numbers: no relation to this patch series,
I just happened to get some timing numbers, this is nice
and low.

This v3 series reduces duplicate code to generate script
in indiviual test Makefiles and consolidates support in
selftests main Makefile. In the main Makefile, it does
minimal work to set and export install path. In this
series exec and powerpc tests are not included in the
install, this work will be done in future patches. exec
and powerpc are still run when make kselftest is invoked.

v2 series: addressed the duplicate code in install and
run_tests targets in individual test Makefiles.
