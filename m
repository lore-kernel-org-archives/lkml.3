Sure, good to be initially cautious but I think if this goes in, it should BUG.

Yeah, lots of badness here. I'll see if I can find someone to look at
solutions for this.

Ah, right, the source. But that shouldn't make it "slow". How about
naming this DEBUG_STRICT_STRCPY_SIZE_CHECKS or something? I can't
imagine the performance from adding a single compare to be bad. You
can even branch-hint it with "if (unlikely(...."
