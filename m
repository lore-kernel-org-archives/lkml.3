Hello,
Re-reading the code, I see that I was wrong with the previous comment of mine.  So, in summary

i) If block driver does not support FLUSH and FUA, then __generic_make_request() checks will clear BIO FLUSH and FUA flags and hence blk_insert_flush() will not be invoked.

ii) If block driver clears FLUSH & FUA flags while IO is in flight, then there is possibility of IO missing __generic_make_request() checks and hitting issue with blk_insert_flush() being discussed here.

iii) If block driver sets only REQ_FUA without REQ_FLUSH then __generic_make_request() checks will not clear BIO flags and hence blk_insert_flush() will be invoked which will hit the blk_insert_flush() issue being discussed here.  However, setting REQ_FUA without REQ_FLUSH is not as per documentation and it is invalid for block driver to do so.

Thanks,
Ajith

Suppose driver claims FLUSH/FUA support then any bio targeted at this driver with FLUSH bit set(which is commonly set by file system like XFS for doing internal logging) has a data corruption vulnerability in case of an abrupt shutdown.  So, IMO the vulnerability is not open to rare window where driver changes q->flush_flags while IO is in flight, but for a much larger window from time driver comes up and throughout it's life.
