No, I think you're confusing algorithms with protocols.  DIF and DIX are
two names for protection envelopes.  DIF verifies integrity from the HBA
to the device surface.  DIX verifies integrity from an application to
the HBA.  Both DIF and DIX have pluggable checksum algorithms (and, in
theory, as long as the HBA does the conversion, they don't have to use
the same one, although the confusion over protection types and
algorithms is so dense already that the only way not to go insane is to
use the same end to end one).  Oracle has the best data sources to
explain this, including Martin's slides:

https://oss.oracle.com/projects/data-integrity/documentation/

The specific problem is that there's no defined interface for any
application to use DIX easily because it has to supply additional
protection information when it reads or writes data and there's no
agreed way to extend read/write to do this and, as Martin has said,
thinging about trying to do this with mmap leads to a "bonghit bonanza".

So, the question is do we need to bother with DIX at all?  No filesystem
uses it and there seems to be weak user demand at best.  We could just
strip DIX, losing the protection envelope from the application to the
HBA but keeping DIF, which is the protection envelope from the HBA to
the device.
