Heh well, given that most of the block mq discussions at LSF have been
you saying you really should get around to cleaning up and posting the
code, you'll understand my wanting to see that happen first ...

I suppose we could try to run a storage workshop within KS, but I think
most of the mini summit slots have already gone.  There's also plumbers
if all slots are gone (I would say that, being biased and on the
programme committee) Ric is running the storage and Filesystems MC
