You mean if it doesn't have the bus logic to emit?  Like ia32 mostly
can't do 64 bit writes ... sure.

Um, gcc assumes architecturally correct alignment; that's why it pads
structures.  Only when accessing packed structures will it use the
lowest unit load/store.

if you have a struct { char a, char b }; and load first a then b with a
constant gcc will obligingly optimise to a short store.

Yes, there is: loads and stores may not migrate into or out of critical
sections.

Actual alignment is pretty irrelevant.  That's why all architectures
which require alignment also have to implement misaligned traps ... this
is a fundamental requirement of the networking code, for instance.

The main problem is gcc thinking there's a misalignment (or a packed
structure).  That causes splitting of loads and stores and that destroys
atomicity.
