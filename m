Sorry for confusion. Let me try to explain it more clearly.

First, what I meant talking about two LOCK_EX locks. Let's consider
this scenario:

pid = fork()
fd = open("/foo"); /* both parent and child has _different_ files */
if (pid == 0)
	/* child only */
	flock(fd, LOCK_EX);

at this point we have two different files pointing to "/foo" and 
only one of them has LOCK_EX on it. So if try to LOCK_EX it again, 
only at child's file this would succeed. So we can distinguish which
file is locked using this method.



Now, what problem this patch is trying to solve. It's quite tricky, 
but still. Let's imagine this scenario:

pid = fork();
fd = open("/foo"); /* yet again -- two different files */
if (pid == 0) {
	flock(fd, LOCK_SH);
	pid2 = fork();
	if (pid2 != 0)
		exit(0);
}

at this point we have:

task A -- the original task with file "/foo" opened
task B -- the first child, that exited at the end
task C -- the 2nd child, that "inherited" a file with the lock from B

Note, that file at A and file at C are two different files (struct 
file-s). And it's only the C's one that is locked.

The problem is that the /proc/locks shows the pid of B in this lock's
owner field. And we have no glue to find out who the real lock owner
is using the /proc/locks.

If we try to do the trickery like the one we did with LOCK_EX above,
this is what we would get.

If putting the 2nd LOCK_SH from A and from C, both attempts would succeed,
so this is not the solution.

If we try to LOCK_EX from A and C, only C would succeed, so this seem
to be the solution, but it's actually not. If there's another pair of 
A' and C' tasks holding the same "/foo" and having the LOCK_SH on C', 
this trick would stop working as none of the tasks would be able to 
put such lock on this file.


Thus, we need some way to find out whether a task X has a lock on file F.
This patch is one of the ways of doing this.

Hope this explanation is more clear.
