They've been built up, but we can still or new values into it.  It looks
fine to me from review, but if you can test it on an actualy hypverv
setup that would be valueable feedback.

We could probably do that.  I don't actually like this whole split
between the blacklist flags, and the bitfields.  I'll see if we can
just get rid of those bitfields an always just use the blacklist
flags directly, now that we have precedence of setting them in drivers
and not just the table keyed by the inquiry data.  But that's a longer
term project, this late in the 3.17 cycle I'd just like to merge
something that gets discards on hyperv to work.
