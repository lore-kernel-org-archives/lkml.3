We can track current exec or even target exec, use the percpu id solution
that was discussed here, and it seems Ingo like the solution:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/3/11/23

Grsecurity already do this!


Now to not break things and allow file descriptor to be passed, we couple
the exec id with the *cred and capability superset* check

The advantage of this solution would be:
* We'll have only a *one* ptrace_may_access(),LSM and permission check
  during ->open() or ->read()/write()...

A one check will do the job.


We do this by:
1) During ->open() store the opener exec id somewhere...

2) Call ptrace_may_access() and LSM check during ->open() or later
during ->read(),write()...

3) Then during ->read(),write(): check if current's exec id matches the
opener exec id, if not then there was an execve and continue with the
cred superset check using file->f_cred, the logic here is to check if
opener is privileged than current:

  * Same user namespace: check same uid, gid and capability superset
  * Different user namespaces: check if opener is an ancestor and its
    file->f_cred->euid is the owner...

   IOW make sure that opener is more privileged than current, or with
   the same privileges!

If it fails we return 0, end of file! otherwise allow the operation.


So if opener execve a more privileged process, the read() will fail.

This will make it easy to have a *one* ptrace_may_access() during all
syscalls!


Thoughts ?
