Good point...

I think we're probably saved there (at least on NFS) by the
check_submounts_and_drop() call in nfs_lookup_revalidate.

Hmmm, that said...I did do most of this testing on a slightly older
kernel that doesn't have that call, and I can't reproduce this problem
on a 3.12-ish kernel. I think this is probably already fixed by Miklos'
patches that added that.

Sorry for the noise!
