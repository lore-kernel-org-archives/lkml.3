Why collapse ? The hole is already there right ? Why not just use
fallocate to allocate the space for the hole. And that's my point
actually. Why not do it this way in the first place, because this is
really counterintuitive.

That does not make any sense. The whole idea behind collapse range
is, well collapse the range which means move the extents. And once
you do that there is nothing to punch out. Puncing first and
collapse later will not bring you anything at all.

You're assuming that everyone will be using it the same way you
intent to use it. That's not true however. There will be perfectly
valid use cases for not allocating space for newly created hole.

management on top of image files - changing the size of the partitions

With insert hole semantics it will give you more flexibility.
