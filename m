That is a bit backwards.

The question is not if it makes sense to enforce that tasks that are
having their cputime measured needs to be grouped for scheduling
purposes, but rather, if it makes sense to collect timing information
collectively for something that is not a scheduling entity.

The fact that you can do it today, is an artifact of the way cgroups
were implemented in the first place. If controllers were bound to a
single hierarchy from the very beginning, I really doubt you would have
any luck convincing people that allowing separate hierarchy grouping
would be necessary for this.

Again, all that said, now that I survived 2012, I would like to be alive
next year as well. And if we break your use case, Linus will kill us. So
we don't plan to do it.
