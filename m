Yes, because I have no idea what _your_ point is.

Let's look at the first submission.

Patch 1 - acked by you.

Patch 2 - discussions on the formatting.  Every comment of yours has
been accounted for, except for one.  I wrote:

     > If you want opcodes visible, you can make them the comments, right?

     Yes, like "/* 0x00 */ CONSTANT, MASK".  I still have a slight
preference
     for the opcodes because if the constant ends up wrong, the
     head-scratching would be higher than if the opcode is wrong (the opcode
     is what you see in the dumps).

You didn't answer; v2 was posted 15 days after the end of the v1 thread,
so you had enough time to post more comments and have them addressed in
v2.  Yo me that means "fair enough".

Patch 3-5 - no comment.

Patch 6 - long discussion, ending with "The vast majority of the
          commands are added because Linux itself is using them", and
          with me removing some commands from the list according to
          your request.

Patch 7-13 - no comment.

Cover letter has no comment either.


So you haven't commented on most patches or on the cover letter, and now
you ask about clarification generically rather than about specific
points of the commit messages or the cover letter.

There is only sensible conclusion I can make.  Namely, that you haven't
even read those commit messages.  So, I'm sorry if you did, but I don't
have a crystal ball to understand what you found wrong, and there's
nothing I can do about it.

If there is a fundamental misunderstanding, that wouldn't help anyway.
We would have the same discussion in reverse when I review your patches.

Well, so far there was just one pass, and not even a full one.
