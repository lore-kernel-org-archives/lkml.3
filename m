On 32-bit:

fs/btrfs/extent_io.c: In function ‘btrfs_free_io_failure_record’:
fs/btrfs/extent_io.c:2166: warning: cast to pointer from integer of
different size

Is there any specific reason extend_state.private is "u64", and not
"unsigned long", or better "void *", or even better
"struct io_failure_record *"?

That would get rid of the (double) cast tricks.
