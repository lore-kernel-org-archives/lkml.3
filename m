Not by my reading of it. Posix states that c/mtime needs to be
updated between the first access and the next msync() call. We
update mtime on the first access, and so therefore we conform to the
posix requirement....

"eventually" is very different behaviour to the current behaviour.

My understanding is that NFS v4 delegations require the underlying
filesystem to bump the version count on *any* modification made to
the file so that delegations can be recalled appropriately. So not
informing the filesystem that the file data has been changed is
going to cause problems.

What does "first page fault" mean?
