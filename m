Can we do one better and add a flag to prevent any non-self pid
lookups?  This might actually be easy on top of the pid namespace work
(e.g. we could change the way that find_task_by_vpid works).

It's far from just being signals.  There's access_process_vm, ptrace,
all the signal functions, clock_gettime (see CPUCLOCK_PID -- yes, this
is ridiculous), and probably some others that I've forgotten about or
never noticed in the first place.
