For that reference count lifetime rule. Sorry I was trying to compare it
with other implemented solutions. /proc/pid/environ will increment the
mm->mm_count inside __mem_open(), thus mm_struct will stay in until
mem_release(). That's it.

In the proposed solution and as noted by Linus, the reference count
from 'struct file' is sufficient for f_cred.

Last, I'm happy with /proc/pid/environ as it is, will not touch it
unless there is a request for it, but this proposed file->f_cred
solution is better:
* Not *all* these /proc/<pid>/* files are interested in acquiring a
  reference to the task's mm and increment its counters.
* It can be adapted to all the /proc/<pid>/* files, we already have the
  file->f_cred
* It allow to pass file descriptors if original opener had enough
  permission. It's explained in [Patch 0/12]
* It allow referencing the correct mm of the currently running
  target task at read(),write()...

  Where other solutions will just block/restrict this behaviour.

Thanks
