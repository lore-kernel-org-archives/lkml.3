Due to the lack of knowledge I can not comment (or even actually
understand) your suggestion.

But it probably falls into the "right fix" category, iow "THE FIX
FROM MAINTAINERS" the temporary sigprocmask() hack should wait for.

I can't implement this by the same reason. And of course I won't
insist that we need some really stupid (and wrong) solution until
someone who understand makes the initialization asynchronous.
