Well, I don't see what functional problems that can bring.

In theory people may want to have them as modules to avoid loading them on
systems that don't use PCI hotplug, but honestly I think that the complexity
this causes us to deal with is not worth it.

Moreover, removing the modularity may actually allow us to solve some ordering
issues once and for good.
