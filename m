I wouldn't be so sure about that.  That is a pretty aggressive
relaxation of ordering that PARISC has enacted here, kind of like the
Alpha "we don't need no stinking byte accesses".

So I'm not trying to push the "all the world is an x86"... certainly not
given that x86 has abnormally strict ordering rules and so is itself an
outlier.  What I *don't* really want to have to deal with is going
through more than causal effort to accommodate outliers which no longer
have any real value -- we have too much work to do.
