I didn't think of that at all.

If userspace does:

ptr = mmap(...);
ptr[0] = 1;
sleep(1);
ptr[0] = 2;
sleep(1);
munmap();

Then current kernels will mark the inode changed on (only) the ptr[0]
= 1 line.  My patches will instead mark the inode changed when munmap
is called (or after ptr[0] = 2 if writepages gets called for any
reason).

I'm not sure which is better.  POSIX actually requires my behavior
(which is most irrelevant).  My behavior also means that, if an NFS
client reads and caches the file between the two writes, then it will
eventually find out that the data is stale.  The current behavior, on
the other hand, means that a single pass of mmapped writes through the
file will update the times much faster.

I could arrange for the first page fault to *also* update times when
the FS is exported or if a particular mount option is set.  (The ext4
change to request the new behavior is all of four lines, and it's easy
to adjust.)

I'll send patches later today.  I want to get msync(MS_ASYNC) working
and pound on them a bit first.
