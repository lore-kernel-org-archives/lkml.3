yes, but that overhead should be as small as possible. Direct reclaim
with such a big target will lead to all types of problems.

Do you really expect that all such users will use MADV_NOHUGEPAGE just
to prevent from reclaim stalls? This sounds unrealistic to me. Instead
we will end up with THP disabled globally. The same way we have seen it
when THP has been introduced and caused all kinds of reclaim issues.

I didn't see significantly improved reclaim efficiency the only
difference was that the reclaim happen less times.
The system time is reduced but the elapsed time is less than 1% improved
in the per-page walk but more than 3 times worse for the other extreme.

I do not think that the presented test case is appropriate for any
reclaim decision evaluation. Linear used-once walker usually benefits
from excessive reclaim in general.
The only point I wanted to raise is that the numbers look much worse
when the memory is used sparsely and thponly is the obvious worst case.

So if you want to increase THP charge success rate then back it by real
numbers from real loads and prove that the potential regressions are
unlikely and biased by the overall improvements. Until then NACK to this
patch from me. The change is too risky.

Besides that I do believe that you do not need this change for the high
limit as it can fail the charge for excessive THP charges same like the
hard limit. So you do not have the high limit escape problem.
As mentioned in other email, reclaiming the whole high limit excess as a
target is even more risky because heavy parallel load on many CPUs can
cause large excess and direct reclaim much more than 512 pages.
