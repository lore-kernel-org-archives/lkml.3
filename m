One supporting example: A low limit interferes with creation of
full stripe writes for RAID controllers.

1. Documentation/block/biodoc.txt needs some updates:

        blk_queue_max_sectors(q, max_sectors)
                Sets two variables that limit the size of the request.

                - The request queue's max_sectors, which is a soft size in
                units of 512 byte sectors, and could be dynamically varied
                by the core kernel.

                - The request queue's max_hw_sectors, which is a hard limit
                and reflects the maximum size request a driver can handle
                in units of 512 byte sectors.

                The default for both max_sectors and max_hw_sectors is
                255. The upper limit of max_sectors is 1024.

There is no function with that name (it is now called
blk_queue_max_hw_sectors), the upper limit of max_sectors
is max_hw_sectors, and the default is misleading (255
is the default if the LLD doesn't provide max_hw_sectors).

2. Testing with hpsa and mpt3sas, this patch works as expected
for this setting.  I/O sizes are still limited by max_segments, 
which is expected.  Something else is still limiting I/O sizes
to 1 MiB, though; probably bio_get_nr_vecs enforcing a maximum
size per bio of BIO_MAX_PAGES 256 (which is 1 MiB with 4 KiB
pages).
