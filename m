Just for clarification, the AIM7 workload is not affected by the current 
d_path() code, they are speed-limited by the lock contention in the 
dcache reference counting code. However, both the d_path() change and  
the dentry reference counting change are needed to to eliminate the 
overhead introduced by the use of the perf-record command.
