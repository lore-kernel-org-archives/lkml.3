Hmm.  The previous version of this patch has been hanging around in -next for a
few weeks without problems (afaik).  With just a raw 3.9-rc[56] I haven't been
able to produce a failed checksum or kernel crash when running with O_DIRECT,
either with the write-after-checksum reproducer or even a simple dd
oflag=direct.  But maybe I've gotten lucky on x86?

So... Andrew: Would you like to pick up the patch with more descriptive
comments?  And, is it too late to push it for 3.9?  Jan seems to think we might
have a bug (though I haven't encountered it).

I'll resend the patch just in case it got eaten.
