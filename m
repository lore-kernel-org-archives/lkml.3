Yes, the references were already given in this email:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/8/31/209

This has been discussed several times on lkml:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/8/28/544

https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/8/28/564 (check Kees's references)

Process open a /proc file and pass the fd to a more privilaged process
that will pass the ptrace_may_access() check, while the original process
that opened that file should fail at the ptrace_may_access()
