The same filtering table being applied to different classes of
hardware is a software bug, but my point is that the practive
essentially entrusts non-insignificant part of security enforcement to
the hardware itself.  The variety of hardware in question is very wide
and significant portion has historically been known to be flaky.

Of course you can't do that by adding dangerous commands to the
existing filtering table which is allowed by default.  I'm saying
"count me out" knob could be good enough.  Neither is perfect but at
least the latter doesn't affect the default cases.

I see.  It really just comes down to plumbing and doesn't seem like a
particularly challenging one at that.

This is being applied to all block devices by default and it's a part
of a vicious circle which is being reinforced by this change.  We
added flawed security mechanism to work around deficiency in software
stack.  The mechanism could be mis-used for other purposed which in
turn developed into other use cases, which then pushes the expansion
of the existing flawed mechanism.  This is a process with postive feed
back built into it.

I feel pretty uncomfortable about the direction and think we should
reach compromise from the other direction.  If VMs need raw device
access, just entrust the device to those VMs and enforce whatever
extra restriction from hypervisor side.  It sure isn't perfect but
neither is the other compromise and the risk is taken by the ones
wanting to do (relatively) exotic stuff rather than forced on all
others.
