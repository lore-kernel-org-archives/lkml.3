Talking about David's efforts at porting Capsicum to Linux, I've
already implemented
support for Capsicum in OpenSSH. It shouldn't be complicated to enable
it on Linux
systems that support it.

I would very like to see capsicum integrated into mainline, as it's a
high quality sandbox
solution, that will benefit a lot of server software that implement
privilege separation.
