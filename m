Right, but generating the equivalent seccomp input environment for an
equivalent single-fd syscall is going to be subtle and complex (which
are worrying words to mention in a security context).  And how many
other syscalls are going to need similar special-case processing?
(poll? select? send[m]msg? ...)

Capsicum capabilities are associated with the file descriptor (a la
F_GETFD), not the open file itself -- different FDs with different
associated rights can map to the same underlying open file.

Attaching the rights to the FD also comes back to the association with
object-capability security.  The FD is an unforgeable reference to the
object (file) in question, but these references (with their rights) can
be transferred to other programs -- either by inheritance after fork, or
by explicitly passing the FD across a Unix domain socket.

I don't know whether libseccomp would worry about this, but being able
to send FDs between processes via Unix domain sockets makes this more
visible in the Capsicum case.

True.  I guess new syscalls are sufficiently rare in practice that this
isn't a serious concern.

Yeah, I tried exactly that a while ago
(https://github.com/google/capsicum-linux/commit/e163c6348328)
but didn't run with it because of the process-wide beneath-only issue below.
But a combination of that and your new prctl() suggestion below might do
the trick.

That sounds like a good idea, particularly in combination with the idea
above -- thanks!  I'll have a think/investigate...
