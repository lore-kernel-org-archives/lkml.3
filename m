But only for mounting / starting up from the nfsroot, it seems.
I wonder if there's an unusual code path for that in there?
The regular stuff looks mostly fine:

        p = xdr_decode_ftype3(p, &fmode);
        fattr->mode = (be32_to_cpup(p++) & ~S_IFMT) | fmode;

Except perhaps that second line ought to use the same mask
as the server side is using, just in case there are some other
stray high (higher than S_IFMT) bits in there now/someday.

Yup.  Who?

Probably a good thing in the longer term, for better compatibility
with non-Linux servers.  But we'll still have to keep the revert
on the server (nfsd) code for backward compatibility, I think.
