Neat idea.

So is it always the case that tasks in a container have the same
namespace settings and capabilities as the child_reaper?

We'll still have the basic problem for nfsd that we'll need to keep
track of what the child_reaper is when nfsd is started, but I think
that's not too hard to solve.
