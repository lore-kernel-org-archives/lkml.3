If an attacker targets multiple distinct systems across a wide range
of system owners, instead of landing the exploit against all of them,
they'll get less than 1% of them, and crash all the rest, removing
them (for a while) from the target pool. Without KASLR, they would
have landed 100% of the attacks.

If an attacker targets multiple systems belonging to a single system
owner, most service providers, if they have that many machines, will
have some level of system monitoring. And when 99% of the hosts go
down, they're going to notice.

KASLR is certainly not a silver bullet, but it dramatically changes
the landscape of what kinds of attacks can be used.
