Hi Hannes,

Sorry to bother you.
Months ago, you made a patch to fix this scsi_scan abort error found on
zfssa storage. Though it's only a specific storage, the logic -- not
abort scsi scan process because of an inquiry failure of a LU in the
middle, is helpful as a way to make our scanning more resilient. I'd
prefer to keep our device scanning behavior in sync with other OS like
Solaris and Windows.
Will you merge your patch in mainline? You can find the patch here
http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg521753.html

Regards,
Vaughan
