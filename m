Then please say so.  I didn't find any comment in your review that I missed.

For patches 1-4, it means that you're allowed to write to media when a
file is opened for reading.  The patches fix this.

For patches 5-12, it means that you currently need root-equivalent
privileges (CAP_SYS_RAWIO) to do "regular business" on any SCSI device
that is not a CD-ROM or a tape or a disk.

For patches 13-14, it means that you currently need root-equivalent
privileges (CAP_SYS_RAWIO) to do operations on SCSI devices that require
some level of trust, hence there is no way to confine this to a single
device.

But all this is in the cover letter, I'm just paraphrasing.

Bugfixes are in patch 1-4.  The patches first introduce the new table
format without any semantic change, then they introduce per-class
filters while still leaving the conflicting commands accessible with
O_RDONLY, and finally fix the bug.  If you have any better ideas, please
tell me.  I did try to optimize for reviewability and bisectability, if
I screwed up I'd like to hear why.

Whitelisting of extra commands is in patch 5-10.  Additional related
changes are in patches 11-14.

Again, all this is in the cover letter.

Paolo
