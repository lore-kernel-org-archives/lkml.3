That's why I said most and not all.  We have a fair amount of drivers
using host-wide tags.  Having to support both models actually is a bit
of an issue with the blk-mq support in scsi.

At this point I suspect we'll have to detangle the concept of tag space
and the queueing limits that blk-mq merged into a single problem space
again to support SCSI properly.

But that doesn't mean a HBA can support the full space.  Unless we know
each piece of hardware detailed enough we can't simplify increase the
tag space as we can be sure something will break.

As long as the drivers don't rely on the block layer tag handling they
can keep whatever they want to do.  Given that it's mostly SPI drivers
I doubt the tag allocation is a performance bottle neck of any sort for
them anyway.
