Ahh -- that's why I had a recollection of such a page ;-).

Yes, I saw it already. (It's good, but I want more.)

The general notion these days is that a (comprehensive) manual page
_should_ come *with* the system call, rather than after the fact. And
there's a lot of value in that. I've found no end of bugs and design
errors while writing (comprehensive) man pages after the fact (by
which time it's too late to fix the design errors), and also found
quite a few of those issues when I've managed to work with folk at the
same time as they write the syscall. Bottom line: you really should
write formal documentation now, as part of the process of code
submission. It improves the chance of finding implementation and
design bugs, and may well widen your circle of reviewers.

Cheers,

Michael
