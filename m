Subject: [PATCH cgroup/for-3.14-fixes] cgroup: update
 cgroup_enable_task_cg_lists() to grab siglock

Currently, there's nothing preventing cgroup_enable_task_cg_lists()
from missing set PF_EXITING and race against cgroup_exit().  Depending
on the timing, cgroup_exit() may finish with the task still linked on
css_set leading to list corruption.  Fix it by grabbing siglock in
cgroup_enable_task_cg_lists() so that PF_EXITING is guaranteed to be
visible.

This whole on-demand cg_list optimization is extremely fragile and has
ample possibility to lead to bugs which can cause things like
once-a-year oops during boot.  I'm wondering whether the better
approach would be just adding "cgroup_disable=all" handling which
disables the whole cgroup rather than tempting fate with this
on-demand craziness.
