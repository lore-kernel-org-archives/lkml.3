Hi,

So I just got back to checking this issue of *extremely low* IO write
performance I got in 3.16-rc2.

Reminder:
I used iSER to benchmark Christoph's scsi-mq patches performance and
noticed that direct-IO writes are stuck at 20-50K IOPs instead of 350K
IOPs I was used to see for a single device. This issue existed also when
I removed the scsi-mq patches, so I started bisecting to see what broke
stuff.

Finally I got to the completely unbisectable bulk that seems to yield
the issue:

/* IO write performance is OK*/

I tried to isolate the issue by running fio on a null_blk
device and also got performance degradation although it wasn't
as severe as with iSER/iSCSI. IO write performance decreased
from 360K IOPs to 280 KIOPs.

So at the moment I can't pin point the problem, but I figured
I'd raise the issue in case anyone else had stepped on this one
(hard to imagine that no one saw this...)

I'll run perf comparison to see if I get anything interesting.
