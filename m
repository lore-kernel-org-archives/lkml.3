VFS already has some sort of this capability - now it's done through flock/LOCK_MAND mechanis, but that approach is non-atomic. This patchset build new capabilities on top of the existing one but doesn't bring any changes into the flock call semantic.

As I understand it, leases play different role: they allow to cache a
data for the particular open and then flush it when a lease break
comes. But we need to protect opens from being done if their
access/share mode is not suitable for previously done opens. E.g. if
we have already opened a file with O_RDONLY | O_DENYWRITE we can't
open it again with any of O_WRONLY, O_RDWR and O_DENYREAD flags (of
course all these things should only work if O_DENYMAND is specified
for the first and the second opens).
