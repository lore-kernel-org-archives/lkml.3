Note that you don't have to use the ext4_sb_info->s_blockgroup_lock.
You can allocate and use a separate struct blockgroup_lock for mbcache
instead of allocating a spinlock array (and essentially reimplementing
the bgl_lock_*() code).  While it isn't a huge amount of duplication,
that code is already tuned for different SMP core configurations and
there is no reason NOT to use struct blockgroup_lock.

I'm not against re-using the s_blockgroup_lock in the superblock, since
the chance of contention on this lock between threads is very small, as
there are normally 4x the number of spinlocks as cores.

You might consider starting with a dedicated struct blockgroup_lock in
the mbcache code, then move to use the in-superblock struct in a later
patch.  That would allow you to push and land the mbcache and ext4 =
patches
independently of the ext2 and ext3 patches (if they are big).  If the
ext2 and ext3 patches are relatively small then this extra complexity
in the patches may not be needed.

Cheers, Andreas
