I think it is the same problem as being able to handle SIGKILL in
responsive manner.  It could be tricky to implement for nfs but it at
least doesn't have to solve the problem twice.

So, yeah, you are thinking pretty much the same as I'm.

I don't know the details of nfs but those events could essentially be
signaling that the system is gonna lose power.  I think it would be a
good idea to solve it.

Thanks.
