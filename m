If you set the parent to NULL, the host template dma_dev will end up
NULL as well and that will trigger a NULL deref panic in the dma segment
routines.

If you want to remove platform_bus, we have to have a well known device
to set dma_dev to at scsi_host_add time.

The parent pointer isn't the problem ... assigning the correct dma
device is.
