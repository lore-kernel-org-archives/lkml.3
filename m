DCACHE_DISCONNECTED doesn't mean that.

When you lookup a dentry by filehandle that dentry is initially marked
DCACHE_DISCONNECTED.  It is cleared only after reconnect_path() has
verified that the dentry is reachable all the way from the root.

So !DCACHE_DISCONNECTED implies that the dentry is connected all the way
up to the root, but the converse is not true.

This has been a source of confusion, but it is explained in
Documentation/filesystems/nfs/Exporting.  Recently I've cleaned up a few
odd uses of DCACHE_DISCONNECTED and rewritten reconnect_path(), partly
as an attempt to clarify the situation.

Let me know if any of that doesn't look right to you....

Actually until f80de2cde10350b8d146e375ff8b634e72e6a827 "dcache: don't
clear DCACHE_DISCONNECTED too early", it was the reverse:
d_materialise_unique cleared DISCONNECTED and d_splice_alias (correctly)
did not.

The only place where it should be cleared is reconnect_path().

Directories are assumed to have unique aliases.  When they don't, the
kernel can deadlock or crash.
