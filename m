So I'm sure I'm not getting it; but why is all the wait_bit crap so
entirely different from the normal wait stuff?

Surely something like:

	wait_event_timeout(&wq, test_bit(bit, word), timeout);

Is pretty much the same, no? The only thing that's different is the wake
function, but surely we can thread that into there somehow without all
this silly repetition.

Furthermore, I count about 23 action functions, of which there appear to
be only like 4 actual variants. Surely such repetition sucks arse and
should be avoided?
