I wonder if this is a similar issue to what I fixed with
(Pavel's patch assumed that these reparse points
were NTFS symlinks but they could be other types
of reparse points such as the new "NFS symlink"
format)

commit c31f330719b7331b2112a5525fe5941a99ac223d
Author: Steve French <smfrench@us.ibm.com>

    do not treat non-symlink reparse points as valid symlinks

    Windows 8 and later can create NFS symlinks (within reparse points)
    which we were assuming were normal NTFS symlinks and thus reporting
    corrupt paths for.  Add check for reparse points to make sure that
    they really are normal symlinks before we try to parse the pathname.

    We also should not be parsing other types of reparse points (DFS
    junctions etc) as if they were a  symlink so return EOPNOTSUPP
    on those.  Also fix endian errors (we were not parsing symlink
    lengths as little endian).

    This fixes commit d244bf2dfbebfded05f494ffd53659fa7b1e32c1
    which implemented follow link for non-Unix CIFS mounts
