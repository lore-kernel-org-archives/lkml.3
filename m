Subject: [PATCH 07/12] perf, x86: Avoid checkpointed counters causing excessive TSX aborts v3

From: Andi Kleen <ak@linux.intel.com>

With checkpointed counters there can be a situation where the counter
is overflowing, aborts the transaction, is set back to a non overflowing
checkpoint, causes interupt. The interrupt doesn't see the overflow
because it has been checkpointed.  This is then a spurious PMI, typically with a
ugly NMI message.  It can also lead to excessive aborts.

Avoid this problem by:
- Using the full counter width for counting counters (previous patch)
- Forbid sampling for checkpointed counters. It's not too useful anyways,
checkpointing is mainly for counting.
- On a PMI always set back checkpointed counters to zero.

v2: Add unlikely. Add comment
v3: Allow large sampling periods with CP for KVM
