This is exactly what I meant by 'current behavior'.

I see no reason why namespaces should behave any different than the rest
of the system, wrt this. And this changes how *and* when these limits
are set, which impacts at a userspace level with no justification.

Why do you need this? Is there any real impact/issue you're seeing?
