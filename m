Just one more thing.  Also, not being able to do retries without
side-effect doesn't mean it can't do retries at all.  There are
syscalls which need to do things differently on re-entry (forgot which
one but there are several).  They record the necessary state in the
restart block and resume from where they left off on re-entry.  It
sure is hairy but is doable and we already have supporting
infrastructure.  Not sure whether that would be worthwhile tho.

Thanks.
