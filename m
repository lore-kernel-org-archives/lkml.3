This should be the final version.

Version 5:
  Tended to Christophe, Ludovic and Angus' comments.

Version 4:
  Tended to Brian's review comments
    - Checkpatch acceptance
    - MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() name slip correction
    - Timeout issue(s) resolved
    - Potential infinite loop mitigated
    - Code clarity suggests heeded
    - Duplication with MTD core code removed
    - Upgraded to using ROUND_UP() helper
    - Moved non-shared header code into main driver
    - Relocated dynamic msg sequence stores into main struct
    - Averted adaption of static (table) data
    - Basic whitespace/spelling/data type/dev_err suggestions applied

Version 3:
  Okay, this thing should be fully functional now. Identify a chip
  based on it's JEDEC ID, Read, Write, Erase (all or by sector).
  Support for various chip quirks added too.

Version 2:
  The first bunch of these patches have been on the MLs before, but
  didn't receive a great deal of attention for the most part. We are
  a little more featureful this time however. We can now successfully
  setup and configure the N25Q256. We still can't read/write/erase
  it though. I'll start work on that next week and will provide it in
  the next instalment.

Version 1:
  First stab at getting this thing Mainlined. It doesn't do a great deal
  yet, but we are able to initialise the device and dynamically set it up
  correctly based on an extracted JEDEC ID.
