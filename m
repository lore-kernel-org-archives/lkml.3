If it is all the same to you, I will call this CPU2 to distinguish it from
the first CPU1.  ;-)

Indeed, life is hard here.  Keep in mind that lock acquisition is not
guaranteed to prevent prior operations from being reordered into the
critical section, possibly as follows:

	CPU1:
	  grab lock
	  if (!global)
	      global = p;
	  /* Assume all of CPU2's accesses happen here. */
	  p->foo = 1;

This clearly allows CPU2 to execute as follows:

	CPU2:
	  p = global; /* gets p */
	  if (p) /* non-NULL */
	  	q = p->foo; /* might not be 1 */

Not only that, on DEC Alpha, even if CPU1's accesses are ordered, CPU2's
accesses can be misordered.  You need rcu_dereference() or the combination
of ACCESS_ONCE() and smp_read_barrier_depends() to avoid this issue.
As always, see http://www.openvms.compaq.com/wizard/wiz_2637.html for
more info.

So no, there is no guarantee.  I am assuming that the lock grabbed by
CPU1 guards all assignments to "global", otherwise the code needs further
help.  I am further assuming that the memory pointed to by CPU1's "p"
is inaccessible to any other CPU, as in CPU1 just allocated the memory.
Otherwise, the assignment "p->foo = 1" is questionable.  And finally,
I am assuming that p->foo stays constant once it has been made
accessible to readers.

But the following should work:

	CPU1:
	  p->foo = 1;  /* Assumes p is local. */
	  smp_mb__before_spinlock();
	  grab lock
	  if (!global)  /* Assumes lock protects all assignments to global. */
	      global = p;

	CPU2:
	  p = rcu_dereference(global);
	  if (p)
	     q = p->foo; /* Assumes p->foo constant once visible to readers. */
	     		 /* Also assumes p and q are local. */

If the assumptions called out in the comments do not hold, you at least
need ACCESS_ONCE(), and perhaps even more synchronization.  For more info
on ACCESS_ONCE(), Jon's LWN article is at http://lwn.net/Articles/508991/.
