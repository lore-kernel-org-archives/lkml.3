  This is really strange. I've verified the code and all the places
modifying b_jlist or b_modified are holding bh_state lock so we should be
safe...

Hum, but I remember I was debugging similar problems with bit fields in
btrfs on ia64 as well (see http://lwn.net/Articles/478657/). So I think what
has happened is that your compiler compiled bitfield access as 64-bit and
updates to b_jcount and b_jlist / b_modified crashed into one another. I
didn't hit it because my compiler was not so "clever".

Grumble. In this case I think bitfields are not worth the trouble with gcc.
It's a pitty we have to spend additional 8 bytes for every journal_head but
we'll survive... I'll send Ted a partial revert and add a comment so that
we won't repeat this mistake in future.
