Hmmm... Why we can't? We can go a bit further with userspace idea.

We use UMH some very limited number of user programs. For 2, actually:
1) /sbin/nfs_cache_getent
2) /sbin/nfsdcltrack

If we convert them into proxies, which use /proc/<pid>/root and /proc/<pid>/ns/*, this will allow us to lookup the right binary.
The only limitation here is presence of this "proxy" binaries on "host".

And we don't need any significant changes in kernel.

BTW, Jeff, could you remind me, please, why exactly we need to use UMH to run the binary?
What are this capabilities, which force us to do so?
