Subject: [PATCH] CIFS: Decrease reconnection delay when switching nics
Date: Mon, 25 Feb 2013 16:28:30 -0600
Message-Id: <1361831310-24260-1-git-send-email-chiluk@canonical.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 1.7.9.5

When messages are currently in queue awaiting a response, decrease amount of
time before attempting cifs_reconnect to SMB_MAX_RTT = 10 seconds. The current
wait time before attempting to reconnect is currently 2*SMB_ECHO_INTERVAL(120
seconds) since the last response was recieved.  This does not take into account
the fact that messages waiting for a response should be serviced within a
reasonable round trip time.

This fixes the issue where user moves from wired to wireless or vice versa
causing the mount to hang for 120 seconds, when it could reconnect considerably
faster.  After this fix it will take SMB_MAX_RTT (10 seconds) from the last
time the user attempted to access the volume or SMB_MAX_RTT after the last
echo.  The worst case of the latter scenario being
2*SMB_ECHO_INTERVAL+SMB_MAX_RTT+small scheduling delay (about 130 seconds).
Statistically speaking it would normally reconnect sooner.  However in the best
case where the user changes nics, and immediately tries to access the cifs
share it will take SMB_MAX_RTT=10 seconds.
