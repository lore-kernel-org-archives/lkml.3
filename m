Any reason why you didn't respond to the kdbus patches themselves?
Critiquing the specific code is much better than random discussions.

What does LTS versions have anything to do here?  And what specific
dependancies are you worried about?

Again, please see the kernel patches for lots of detail as to why this
should be in the kernel.  If you disagree with the specific statements I
have listed there, please respond with specifics.

The latest version is a filesystem not a character device, your
information is out of date :)

Take that up on the systemd mailing list, it's not a kernel issue.
