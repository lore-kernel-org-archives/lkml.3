I think that is not really possible to tell when we invoke it. It is very much 
target device (or file system, etc) dependent on how long it takes. It could be 
as simple as a reflink copying in a smallish amount of metadata or fall back to 
a full byte-by-byte copy.  Also note that speed is not the only impact here, 
some of the mechanisms actually do not consume more space (just increment shared 
data references).

It would probably make more sense to send it off to the target device and have 
it return an error when not appropriate (then the app can fall back to the old 
fashion copy).
