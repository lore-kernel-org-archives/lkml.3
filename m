Fair enough. Implications of a new userspace ABI can be significant and 
I can accept not introducing a new one in the kernel.

The queuing problem caused by a task taking a contended lock just before 
its current timeslice is up which userspace app wouldn't know about, is 
a real problem nevertheless. My patch attempts to avoid the contention 
in the first place. futex with adaptive spinning is a post-contention 
solution that tries to minimize the cost of contention but does nothing 
to avoid the contention. Solving this problem using futex can help only 
if the userspace lock uses futex.

I have looked at solving this problem in userspace using priority 
inheritance semaphore but ran into many problems. I will go back and 
take another look at it.

I appreciate your feedback.

Thanks,
Khalid
