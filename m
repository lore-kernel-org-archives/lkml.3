true, but we could call do_gettimeofday() in the routine when we know
we're sending it.  And it only does this once every 8 hours.  My
complaint is the do_gettimeofday() sitting in the fast path to see if
the eight hours since the last time we sent the ffdc timestamp have
elapsed.

Actually, isn't there a version of the syscall that does return what
this firmware is looking for (the year, month, day, hour, seconds
values)?

Right, but it has its own wierd conversion formula, which is dictated by
the HW.

For an 8 hour interval it is provided we have the proper comparisons.

heh, well we need to correct ips_fix_ffdc_time() somehow.  I think
converting the trigger mechanism to jiffies makes sense because the
interval is so small and we already have the jiffies code overflow safe.
