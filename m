So one version of gcc doesn't do it.  Others do because I've been
surprised seeing it in assembly.

Actually, that's not correct.  This is actually deja vu with me on the
other side of the argument.  When we first did spinlocks on PA, I argued
as you did: lock only a barrier for code after and unlock for code
before.  The failing case is that you can have a critical section which
performs an atomically required operation and a following unit which
depends on it being performed.  If you begin the following unit before
the atomic requirement, you may end up losing.  It turns out this kind
of pattern is inherent in a lot of mail box device drivers: you need to
set up the mailbox atomically then poke it.  Setup is usually atomic,
deciding which mailbox to prime and actually poking it is in the
following unit.  Priming often involves an I/O bus transaction and if
you poke before priming, you get a misfire.

Yes, I think I can agree that the only real problem is gcc thinking the
store or load needs splitting.
