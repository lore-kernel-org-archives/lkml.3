Yes, the question is whether this in itself is a practical problem,
regardless of whether you use __GFP_NOFAIL or a manual loop.

The problems in the page allocator and memcg are entirely unrelated.
What we do in the memcg does not affect the page allocator and vice
versa.  However, they are problems of the same type, so we are trying
to find out whether both instances can have the same solution:

If GFP_NOFS | __GFP_NOFAIL allocations can not make forward progress
in direct reclaim, they are screwed: can't reclaim memory, can't OOM
kill, can't return NULL.  They are essentially stuck until a third
party intervenes.  This applies to both the page allocator and memcg.

In memcg, I fixed it by allowing the __GFP_NOFAIL task to bypass the
user-defined memory limit after reclaim fails.

David asks whether we should do the equivalent in the page allocator
and allow __GFP_NOFAIL allocations to dip into the emergency memory
reserves for the same reason.

I suggested that the situations are not entirely the same.  A memcg
might only have one or two tasks and so third party intervention to
reduce memory usage in the memcg can be unlikely to impossible,
whereas in the case of the page allocator, the likelihood of any task
in the system releasing or reclaiming memory is higher.

However, the GFP_NOFS | __GFP_NOFAIL task stuck in the page allocator
may hold filesystem locks that could prevent a third party from
freeing memory and/or exiting, so we can not guarantee that only the
__GFP_NOFAIL task is getting stuck, it might well trap other tasks.
The same applies to open-coded GFP_NOFS allocation loops of course
unless they cycle the filesystem locks while looping.
