Broken in the sense that we don't run them in the container yes.

I tried using the keys api for the uid mapping of containers and I wound
up being very disappointed because for testing/debugging I could never
flush any result I had ever returned a key for.  Which rather soured me
on the real-world usability of the key based user mode helpers.  Perhaps
I was doing it wrong but it seemed like a very brittle interface, that
was intollerant of human failures.

One thing we have done with the core dump helper is because there is
enough information to know the namespaces of the program dumping core
have the root owned and installed helper use setns to get inside the
namespaces so we can have a per namespace core dump policy.

If we can provide enough context to the other helpers that is probably
the easiest way to go.

The question is can we truly pass enough state.

Yes.

So far I don't think we can trigger any of these upcalls from inside of
a user namespace so we aren't in trouble yet.  But it is definitely
worth looking at.   Because we are basically one person scratching their
itch to get some feature working from being at the point where nfs or
something else that uses the upcalls needs the support.
