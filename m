  So I like the simplicity of your code but there are a few downsides too
(please correct me if I've got something wrong - btw the documentation of
high-level design would be welcome so that one doesn't have to understand
that from the patches):
1) The bandwidth controller simply accounts number of bytes submitted for
IO in submit_bio().  This doesn't reflect HW capabilities in any way. There
a huge difference between a process submitting single block random IO and a
process doing the same amount of sequential IO. This could be somewhat
dealt with by not accounting number of bytes but rather time it took to
complete a bio (but that somewhat complicates the code and block layer
already does similar counting so it would be good you used that).

2) The controller accounts bio to current task - that makes the limiting
useless for background writeback. You need to somehow propagate i_memcg
into submit_bio() so that IO is properly accounted.

3) The controller doesn't seem to guarantee any quality of service at the
IO level like blkcg does. The controller limits amount of IO userspace is
able to submit to kernel but only after we decide to submit the IO to disk.
So at that time cgroup may have generated lots of IO - e.g. by dirtying lots
of pages - and there's nothing to protect other cgroups from starvation
because of writeback of these pages.

Especially the last point seems to be essential to your approach (although
you could somewhat mitigate the issue by accounting the IO already when
it is entering the kernel) and I'm not sure whether that's really
acceptable for potential users of this feature.
