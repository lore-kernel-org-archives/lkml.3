   Yes, it probably does need a lot of work. This is (at least one
reason) why it's not been done yet. If you want to work on doing this,
then please do. However, don't expect anyone else to give you a
detailed plan of what code to write. Don't expect anyone else to write
the code for you. You will have to come up with your own ideas as to
how to implement it, and actually do it yourself, including building
it, and testing it.

   That's not to say that you are on your own, though. People will
help -- provided that you aren't asking them to do all the work. You
are not an empty vessel to be filled with the wisdom of the ancients.
This means that *you* have to take action. You have to take yourself
as far as you can in learning how things work. When you get stuck,
work out what it is that you don't know, and then ask about that one
thing. This makes it easier to answer, it shows that you're putting in
effort on your side, and it means that you *actually learn things*.
Questions like "what function should I be modifying?", or "how do you
want me to do this?" show that you haven't put in even the smallest
piece of effort, and will be ignored (f you're lucky). Questions like
"I'm trying to implement a crumble filter, but in the mix_breadcrumbs
function, how does it take account of the prestressed_yoghurt field?"
show that you've read and understood at least some of the code, and
have thought about what it's doing.

   Hugo.
