Hmm, yes, that would be a nice outcome.

I guess?  I don't find requiring --reflink hugely compelling.  But there
it is.

Sure.  So we'd have:

- no flag default that forbids knowingly copying with shared references
  so that it will be used by default by people who feel strongly about
  their assumptions about independent write durability.

- a flag that allows shared references for people who would otherwise
  use the file system shared reference ioctls (ocfs2 reflink, btrfs
  clone) but would like it to also do server-side read/write copies
  over nfs without additional intervention.

- a flag that requires shared references for callers who don't want
  giant copies to take forever if they aren't instant.  (The qemu guys
  asked for this at Plumbers.)

I think I can live with that.
