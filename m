Thanks for revisiting that :>

Exposing "DIRECT" to userspace now might confuse users into expecting
O_DIRECT behavior.  I say this as an easily-confused user.

In the future, perhaps O_DIRECT behavior can become per-splice (instead
of just per-open) and can save SPLICE_F_DIRECT for that.

Another syscall?  I prefer not.  Better to just maintain the sendfile
API as-is for compatibility reasons and nudge users towards splice.

I'll try to test/comment more in a week or two (not much time for
computing until then).
