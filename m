That's the whole bloody problem in a nutshell.

We only want to freeze the filesystem when the network goes down, and in
that case we want time to clean up first. That's why it needs to be
initiated by something like NetworkManager _before_ the network is shut
down.

It _shouldn't_ be an interruption unless the filesystem can't make
progress.
