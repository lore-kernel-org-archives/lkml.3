Perhaps systemd needs the fix too, I do not know. But this is irrelevant,
I think. Or at least this should be discussed separately.

kthread_run() can fail anyway, mptsas_probe() should not crash the kernel.

And btw, it is not clear to me if in this case device initialization really
needs more than 30 seconds... My understanding is probably wrong, so please
correct me. But it seems that before your "make kthread_create() killable"

	- probe hangs

	- SIGKILL wakes it up

	- so I assume that the probe was interrupted and didn't finish
	  correctly ???

	- initialization continues, does scsi_host_alloc(), etc, and
	  everything works fine even if probe was interrupted?

So perhaps that probe should not hang and this should be fixed too ?
Do you know where exactly it hangs? And where it is woken up by SIGKILL ?
Or I totally misunderstood ?

Well, personally I do not care about TIF_MEMDIE/oom at all. We need the
temporary hack (unless we have the "right" fix right now) which should be
reverted later.

You mean, in kthread_create() ? And, sufficient for what?

firstly, it should not. And almost every caller of recalc_sigpending() outside
of core signal code is wrong.

Not sure I understand... Yes, wait_for_completion_killable() can return
immediately if TIF_SIGPENDING will be set again for any reason. Say, another
signal. But the next iteration will clear TIF_SIGPENDING ?

Ah, I see, you mean that kmalloc() can do this every time. No, this should
not happen or we have another problem.

In any case. My only point is that the regression should be fixed here, imho.
And just in case, let me repeat that the code above is the dirty temporary hack.
I won't insist on the ugly TIF_SIGPENDING games, say, we can use workqueue.

Can't understand this part too... and it was you who suggested to check
TIF_MEMDIE.

Anyway. I agree with any hack in scsi_host_alloc/etc, this is up to
maintainers. I still think that your change uncovered the problems in
drivers/message/fusion/, these problems should be fixed somehow.

Dear maintainers, we need your help.

Oleg.
