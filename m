Is the __vdso_findsym(name, version) approach good?  I don't know why
the vdso uses symbol versions at all, nor do I know why it uses weak
symbol aliases.  The vdso's "clock_gettime" isn't a drop-in
replacement for glibc's: it doesn't touch error, and it returns
negative error codes.

It might make more sense to promise that the vdso will never export to
functions with the same name but different versions and to just get
rid of the version field from __vdso_findsym.  I tried implementing
this; it's untested, but the text size is only 230 bytes :)

It might also make sense to look up by number.  Yes, it smells like
Windows DLLs, but it also looks awfully like Linux syscalls, which do
just fine using a call-by-number scheme.
