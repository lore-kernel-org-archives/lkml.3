I asked you to pull my fscache branch on the 23rd May, and you replied on the
27th May saying you'd done so.

Looking in next-20130531 and next-20130527 in linux-next:

	+fscache                ccce57fed1ffb98ad4ff7c290276ca266435ad19

Looking in next-20130603 and next-20130701, I see:

	+fscache		bbd645c7a7b56f170940e81335ba4549f50aae95

in the Next/SHA1s file.  This is the same as the fscache-20130619 tag that I
emplaced today, though the fscache _branch_ you've been pulling had been at
that point for over a month (not yet a month and a half, I will admit).  git
request-pull seems to pick up tags in preference to branch points.

Comparing fscache-20130619 to fscache-20130702 shows:

	warthog>git diff fscache-20130619 fscache-20130702 | wc -l
	0

The only difference being in the descriptions (additional Acked-by lines).

I picked 19th June for the old tag name because that was the date I added in
the Acked-by lines, so this pins the point just before that.  In retrospect, I
should've used the commit date on the last patch.

As for public mailing lists, most of my patches have been presented as a set
on several such (fsdevel, nfs, cachefs and lkml) a couple of times (3rd May,
10th May).
