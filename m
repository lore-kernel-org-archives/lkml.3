+.SH NAME
+getusers, setusers \- get/set list of supplementary user IDs
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B #include <sys/types.h>
+.br
+.B #include <unistd.h>
+.sp
+.BI "int getusers(int " size ", uid_t *" list );
+.sp
+.BI "int setusers(int " size ", const uid_t *" list );

+Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
+.BR feature_test_macros (7)):
+.in
+.sp
+.BR getusers (),
+.BR setusers ():
+_GNU_SOURCE
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.PP
+.BR getusers ()
+returns the supplementary user IDs of the calling process in
+.IR list .
+The argument
+.I size
+should be set to the maximum number of items that can be stored in the
+buffer pointed to by
+.IR list .
+If the calling process has more than
+.I size
+supplementary user IDs,
+.BR getusers ()
+returns an error.
+The returned list may or may not include the real, effective, saved, or filesystem user ID of the calling process.
+
+If
+.I size
+is zero,
+.I list
+is not modified, but the total number of supplementary user IDs for the
+process is returned.
+This allows the caller to determine the size of a dynamically allocated
+.I list
+to be used in a further call to
+.BR getusers ().
+.PP
+.BR setusers ()
+sets the supplementary user IDs for the calling process.
+The
+.I size
+argument specifies the number of supplementary user IDs
+in the buffer pointed to by
+.IR list .
+
+Any process may drop user IDs from its supplementary list; however, adding user
+IDs not already present in the supplementary list or in the real, effective, or
+saved user ID requires the
+.B CAP_SETUID
+capability.
+.SH RETURN VALUE
+On success,
+.BR getusers ()
+returns the number of supplementary user IDs.
+On error, \-1 is returned, and
+.I errno
+is set appropriately.
+
+On success,
+.BR setusers ()
+returns 0.
+On error, \-1 is returned, and
+.I errno
+is set appropriately.
+.SH ERRORS
+.TP
+.B EFAULT
+.I list
+has an invalid address.
+.PP
+.BR getusers ()
+can additionally fail with the following error:
+.TP
+.B EINVAL
+.I size
+is less than the number of supplementary user IDs, but is not zero.
+.PP
+.BR setusers ()
+can additionally fail with the following errors:
+.TP
+.B EINVAL
+.I size
+is greater than
+.B NUSERS_MAX
+(65536).
+.TP
+.B ENOMEM
+Out of memory.
+.TP
+.B EPERM
+.I list
+contains user IDs not present in the current supplemental user IDs list,
+and not equal to the real, effective, or saved user ID, and the calling
+process does not have
+.BR CAP_SETUID .
+.SH CONFORMING TO
+.BR getusers (),
+.BR setusers (),
+and supplementary user IDs in general are Linux-specific and should not
+be used in programs intended to be portable.
+.SH NOTES
+A process can have up to
+.B NUSERS_MAX
+supplementary user IDs in addition to the real, effective, and saved
+user IDs.
+The constant
+.B NUSERS_MAX
+is defined in
+.IR <limits.h> .
+The set of supplementary user IDs is inherited from the parent process,
+and preserved across an
+.BR execve (2).
+
+The maximum number of supplementary user IDs can be found at run time
+using
+.BR sysconf (3):
+.nf
+
+    long nusers_max;
+    nusers_max = sysconf(_SC_NUSERS_MAX);
+
+.fi
+The maximum return value of
+.BR getusers ()
+cannot be larger than this value.
