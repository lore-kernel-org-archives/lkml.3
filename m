I'll look in to giving you the actual test case.  But I'm not sure of
the licensing on it.

Essentially, the test creates an (small (~256MB) ext4 fs on a
loopback-mounted ramfs device.  It then goes and creates 160 64GB sparse
files (one per cpu) and then cp's them all to /dev/null.

Does it need to be _strictly_ in order, though?  In other words, do you
truly need a *global*, perfectly in-order LRU?

You could make per-cpu LRUs, and batch movement on and off the global
LRU once the local ones get to be a certain size.  Or, you could keep
them cpu-local *until* the shrinker is called, when the shrinker could
go drain all the percpu ones.

Or, you could tag each extent in memory with its last-used time.  You
write an algorithm to go and walk the tree and attempt to _generally_
free the oldest objects out of a limited window.
