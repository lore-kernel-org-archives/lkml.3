Subject: [PATCH v7 0/7] Add O_DENY* support for VFS and CIFS/NFS
Date: Fri, 17 Jan 2014 14:07:05 +0400

This patchset adds support of O_DENY* flags for Linux fs layer. These flags can be used by any application that needs share reservations to organize a file access. VFS already has some sort of this capability - now it's done through flock/LOCK_MAND mechanis, but that approach is non-atomic. This patchset build new capabilities on top of the existing one but doesn't bring any changes into the flock call semantic.

These flags can be used by NFS (built-in-kernel) and CIFS (Samba) servers and Wine applications through VFS (for local filesystems) or CIFS/NFS modules. This will help when e.g. Samba and NFS server share the same directory for Windows and Linux users or Wine applications use Samba/NFS share to access the same data from different clients.

According to the previous discussions the most problematic question is how to prevent situations like DoS attacks where e.g /lib/liba.so file can be open with DENYREAD, or smth like this. That's why extra mount option 'sharelock' is added for switching on/off O_DENY* flags processing. It allows to avoid use of these flags on critical places (like /, /lib) and turn them on if we really want it proccessed that way.

So, we have 3 new flags:
O_DENYREAD - to prevent other opens with read access,
O_DENYWRITE - to prevent other opens with write access,
O_DENYDELETE - to prevent delete operations

The patchset avoids data races problem on newely created files: open with O_CREAT can return the -ESHAREDENIED error for a successfully created file if this files was locked with a sharelock by another task. Also, it turns flock/LOCK_MAND capability off for mounts with 'sharelock' option. This lets not mix one share reservation approach with another.

Patches #1, #2 and #3 add O_DENY* flags to fcntl and implement VFS part. A patch #4 is related to CIFS client changes, #5 -- NFSD, #6 and #7 describe NFSv4 client parts.

The preliminary patch for Samba that replaces the existing use of flock/LOCK_MAND mechanism with O_DENY* flags:
http://git.etersoft.ru/people/piastry/packages/?p=samba.git;a=commitdiff;h=173070262b7f29134ad6b2e49a760017c11aec4a

The future part of open man page patch:

-----
O_DENYREAD, O_DENYWRIYE, O_DENYDELETE - used to inforce a mandatory share reservation scheme of the file access. If these flag is passed, the open fails with -ESHAREDENIED in following cases:
1) if O_DENYREAD flag is specified and there is another open with READ access to the file;
2) if O_DENYWRITE flag is specified and there is another open with WRITE access to the file;
3) if READ access is requested and there is another open with O_DENYREAD flags;
4) if WRITE access is requested and there is another open with O_DENYWRITE flags.

If O_DENYDELETE flag is specified and the open succeded, any further unlink operation will fail with -ESHAREDENIED untill this open is closed. Now this flag is processed by VFS and CIFS filesystem. NFS returns -EINVAL for opens with this flag.

This mechanism is done through flocks. If O_DENY* flags are specified, flock syscall is processed after the open. The share modes are translated into flock according the following rules:
1) !O_DENYREAD   -> LOCK_READ   | LOCK_MAND
2) !O_DENYWRITE  -> LOCK_WRITE  | LOCK_MAND
3) !O_DENYDELETE -> LOCK_DELETE | LOCK_MAND
