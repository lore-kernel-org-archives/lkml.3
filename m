 * Documentation/workqueue.txt (in general, grep in Documentation
   usually throws up something useful)

 * grep -r alloc_workqueue fs/ shows a lot of uses (including in
   btrfs), so it should be fairly easy to see how to create and manage
   a workqueue.

   I suspect that this may be a medium-sized project, rather than a
small one. My gut feeling (based on limited experience) is that the
fallocate extensions project would be considerably simpler.

   I also noticed from the public reply to the private mail (don't do
this without getting permission from the other person) that you posted
to LKML in this thread (don't switch mailing lists mid-thread) that
you anticipated having problems testing with limited disks -- what you
will find is that testing new kernel code is something that you don't
do on your main development OS installation. Instead, you will need
either a scratch machine that you can easily update, or one or more
virtual machines. qemu/kvm is good for this, because it has a mode
that bypasses the BIOS and bootloader emulation, and just directly
runs a kernel from a file on the host machine. This is fast. You can
pass large sparse files to the VM to act as scratch disks, plus keep
another smaller file for the guest OS (and a copy of it so that you
can throw one away and make another one quickly and easily).

   Hugo.
