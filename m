no it's not. Specially when you consider that your "speed" argument can
be just about anything and depending on the underlying bus, it *will* be
treated differently. Note that e.g. in OMAP devices the exact *same* PHY
IP is used for PCIe, SATA and USB... now, let's assume for the sake of
argument that we were to implement ->set_speed() in that environment,
how do you plan to do that ? a 6MHz arguments isn't valid from USB stand
point and could mean different things in PCIe or SATA.

anything for testing purposes, should be limited to test scenarios.

hey, calm down... just trying to prevent us from applying something
which isn't truly generic and I don't think "->set_speed" is generic
enough. The semantics of the "speed" argument won't be valid for all use
cases.

I can already see people using that to pass
USB_SPEED_{LOW,FULL,HIGH,SUPER}, instead of actual speed numbers. We wil
end up with a mess to handle from a PHY driver, specially in cases such
as OMAP where, as mentioned above, the same IP is used for SATA, PCIe
and USB3.
