Try testing it.  It's easy with virtualization and xfstests.

You'll find that sending to a file fails because each individual file
write call that makes up a send starts at offset 0 -- at the start of
the file.

Getting this right means getting the semantics around updating the send
descriptors f_pos right.  It requires having a bit of a think about send
semantics and f_pos update locking.
