I don't know mapping_gfp_mask(). I just add gfp at the original code.
Whould you tell me why it is undesirable?

I think the common interface is important.

If sb_getblk_unmovable() is obvious for the filesystem,
I will add some codes for getblk_unmovable() which calling __getblk_gfp(),
and sb_bread_unmovable() calling __bread_gfp().
If so, sb_bread_gfp is not necessary.

It might be like followings:

Is it better?

Thank you for your advice.
