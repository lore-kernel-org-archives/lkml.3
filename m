So PF_FSTRANS no longer means "filesystem in transaction context".
Are you going to rename to match whatever it's meaning is now?
I'm not exactly clear on what it means now...

I think KM_NOFS needs to remain here, as it has use outside of
transaction contexts that set PF_FSTRANS....

We still need to ensure this rule isn't broken. If it is, the
filesystem will silently deadlock in delayed allocation rather than
gracefully handle the problem with a warning....

Cheers,
