Trivial nits (take them or leave them):

seccomp_check_mode confused me.  Maybe seccomp_may_assign_mode would
be a better name.

In the writer locking changelog, should "(which is unique to the
thread group)" be "(which is shared by all threads in the thread
group)"?

This bit:

    /*
     * Explicitly enable no_new_privs here in case it got set
     * between the task_struct being duplicated and holding the
     * sighand lock. The seccomp state and nnp must be in sync.
     */
    if (task_no_new_privs(current))
        task_set_no_new_privs(p);

should arguably move the very end of task duplication -- someone will
want it for some other purpose some day.

This bit:

    /* If we have a seccomp mode, enable the thread flag. */
    if (p->seccomp.mode != SECCOMP_MODE_DISABLED)
        set_tsk_thread_flag(p, TIF_SECCOMP);

is not quite obvious to me -- it's not obvious why it's needed.  If
it's to eliminate a race, can you explain the race in the comment?  If
it's just paranoia, a WARN_ON or BUG_ON might be worthwhile.

SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_MASK seems backwards to me.  Maybe rename it to
SECCOMP_FILTER_ALLOWED_FLAGS and invert it?

is_ancestor: calling the first parameter "candidate" is just a tiny
bit odd -- it's the child that's up for consideration.  (This is
barely even worth the time it took me to type it.)

Less trivial nits:

Can you change:

fp = kzalloc(fp_size, GFP_KERNEL|__GFP_NOWARN);

to

fp = kcalloc(fprog->len, sizeof(struct sock_filter), GFP_KERNEL|__GFP_NOWARN);

somewhere in this series (w/ a changelog comment that it's not
exploitable to avoid scaring people).

In seccomp_prepare_user_filter, would it make sense to return -EINVAL
if !user_filter?  That will make it slightly more pleasant to
implement TSYNC-without-change if anyone ever wants it.  (This isn't
really necessary -- it's just slightly more polite.)


Once James picks this up, I'll rebase my series on top of it.  I think
they'll conflict slightly.

Feel free to add my Reviewed-by to the whole series except the ARM and
MIPS patches.


And some thoughts:

Your changelog comment for the seccomp syscall suggests that you're
thinking about extending the tracer interface.  I'd suggest a rather
different design: add a concept of a seccomp monitor associated with a
particular filter and an action SECCOMP_RET_MONITOR.
SECCOMP_RET_MONITOR will tell the monitor what syscall was attempted
and will wait for further instructions.  The monitor can then ask for
zero or more syscalls to be issued on behalf of the waiting process
and then resume it.  Each of those additional syscalls will be further
filtered through all seccomp filters outside of the one that returned
SECCOMP_RET_MONITOR.

This would avoid all of the nastiness inherent in using ptrace and
would nest much more nicely.  And it could be far faster.

If you decide to do something to ARM along the lines of what I'm doing
to x86, you may want to fix this:

    /*
     * Make sure that any changes to mode from another thread have
     * been seen after TIF_SECCOMP was seen.
     */
    rmb();

It should have essentially no effect on x86, though.
