Hi Hong,

Thanks for the token based throttling implementation. In general it looks
good and it simplies the logic. Couple of comments/concerns below.

Can we rename this variable to say last_dispatch[2].

So here we seem to be calculating how many tokens a group is eligible
for. This is done based on since last time check. And last time check
was updated in last dispatch from the group.

What happens if no IO happens in a group for some time, say for 5 minutes,
and then one big IO comes in. IIUC, we will allow a big burst of IO for
the first IO (tokens worth of full 5 minutes will be given to this group).
I think we should have a mechanism where we don't allow too big a burst
for the first IO. (Possibly limit the burst to THROTL_BURST_IO and
THROTL_BURST_BYTES until and unless a bigger IO is already queued and
we are waiting for it).

In previous time slice logic, I took care of it by extend time slice
by 100ms and if no IO happens in the group for 100ms, time slice will
expire and next IO will get at max of 100ms of worth of credit (equivalent
of burst limits).

Thanks
Vivek
