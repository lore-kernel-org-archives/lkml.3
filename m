I have been using kmem_ only in functions that will deal directly with
the slab caches and with the single purpose of operating them.

kmem_cache_destroy_work_func => worker interface to kmem_cache_destroy
kmem_cache_destroy_memcg_children => cache destructor iterator
kmem_cache_dup => interface to kmem_cache_create

All the other functions start with memcg_
Analogously, all slab-side functions that deal with memcg *ends* with
_memcg. except the functions that are only there to operate memcg data
structures:

memcg_update_all_caches.

In general, those functions could very well live in the other file (slab
or memcg), but they need to take locks or manipulate data structures
that are internal to slab/memcg.

I believe this is a sound convention.
