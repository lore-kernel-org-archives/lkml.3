That is currently the plan.

It's still unclear how this will work wrt to existing target code, but
given the amount of logic that NVMe is borrowing from SCSI on the
command set side (PR, ALUA, VAAI, DIF), I'm sure there is an opportunity
for code sharing between NVMe and SCSI based fabrics.

Glad to hear that your involved.  ;)

FYI, Kiran and Dave (CC'ed) from Intel will be driving upstream NVME-OF
target development.

I'll be primarily focused on figuring out how NVMe and SCSI can play
nicely in target-core, and helping out on the NVMe-OF side where
necessary.
