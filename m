For commands that are used by Linux already, the right way to fix the
problems is not obscuring the commands from userspace's view.  You can
hit the same problems with ioctls or even with normal operation of the
device.

And prohibiting the extension of whitelists is gonna increase the
usage of unpriv_sgio and less-secure userspace whitelists.

For example:

        if (bdev_write_same(bdev)) {
                unsigned char bdn[BDEVNAME_SIZE];

                if (!blkdev_issue_write_same(bdev, sector, nr_sects, gfp_mask,
                                             ZERO_PAGE(0)))
                        return 0;

                bdevname(bdev, bdn);
                pr_err("%s: WRITE SAME failed. Manually zeroing.\n", bdn);
        }

        return __blkdev_issue_zeroout(bdev, sector, nr_sects, gfp_mask);

The device exposes the ability to zero out LUN blocks, but the command is
not whitelisted and it fails.
