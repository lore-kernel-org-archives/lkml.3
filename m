I don't understand this reply.

No one ever reported that the tty bitfield was being corrupted on any arch,
even though the serialization was broken because the bitfield was being
accessed with different locks. This was likely never discovered because
the corrupted tty state was unlikely to be reproduced easily.

Nevertheless, it needs fixing because it's wrong; so I did.

You pointed out my original fix was incorrect because Alpha CPUs could
still overwrite adjacent state if only bytes were used as separate memory
locations for each state. Ok.

Likewise, I'm pointing that byte-sized circular buffers will also be 
corrupted under certain circumstances (when the head comes near the tail).

Your claim that no one has complained about it (other than me) is no
different than if I had dismissed your objection to my original fix by
saying no one has complained about it.

There could be many motives for why someone with a 20-year old processor
that sees data corruption occasionally has not filed a bug about it, even
if they did bother to track down the original cause (which is pretty unlikely).

I did not ignore this point.

Firstly, I thought Peter's reply was on-point:

Secondly, I replied:

1. The question of why I chose to solve this problem without
set_bit(), et.al. I already answered:

2. I'm not sure where you arrived at the conclusion that set_bit() et.al. is
fast on x86. Besides the heavy-duty instructions (lgdt, mov cr0, etc), the
bus-locked bit instructions are among the most expensive instructions in the
kernel.

I've attached a smoke test I use for lightweight validation of pty slave reads.
If you run this smoke test under perf, almost every high-value hit is a
bus-locked bit instruction. Check out canon_copy_from_read_buf() which performs
the actual copy of data from the line discipline input buffer to the __user
buffer; the clear_bit() is the performance hit. Check out cpu_idle_loop()...

Regards,
Peter Hurley

How I run perf:
$ echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict
$ echo -1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid
$ perf record -a -g ./tty_test1
$ perf report [-k whereever your vmlinux is ]
