Its more about not doing any background activities on these CPU which can
be avoided. So, even if a add_timer() is issued from these isolated CPUs, it
should goto the set chosen for doing background activity, unless add_timer_on()
has been issued, in which case user wants that code to execute on the
isolated core.

Probably, yes, people would be disabling load_balancing between these
cpusets to avoid migration of tasks to isolated core as well.. Atleast we
are using it :)

Yeah, there is no check for that. But I didn't got your point completely.
Why do I need to check for exclusivity on the isolated CPUs? So, that
same CPU isn't isolated as well as non-isolated on two separate sets?

Thanks for your feedback.
