We don't trap every mmap modification. We trap every modification
that the filesystem is informed about. That includes a c/mtime
update on every write page fault. It's as fine grained as we can get
without introducing serious performance killing overhead.

And nobody has made any compelling argument that what we do now is
problematic - all we've got is a microbenchmark doesn't quite scale
linearly because filesystem updates through a global filesystem
structure (the journal) don't scale linearly.

IIUC, you are saying is that you'll maintain the current behaviour
(i.e. clean->dirty does a timestamp update) if the filesystem
requires it? So the default behaviour of any filesystem that
supports NFSv4 is going to behave as it does now?

If that's the case, why bother changing anything as nfsv4 is the
default version that the kernel uses? (I'm playing devil's advocate
here).

That's wrong. The server wrote the dirty page before the client
reconnected, therefore it got marked clean. The second write to the
server page marks it dirty again, causing page_mkwrite to be
called, thereby updating the timestamp/i_version field. So, the NFS
client will notice the second change on the server, and it will
notice it immediately after the second access has occurred, not some
time later when:

Your patches introduce a 30+ second window where a file can be dirty
on the server but the NFS server doesn't know about it and can't
tell the clients about it because i_version doesn't get bumped until
writeback.....

Right, and the issue is that there are important use cases that we
have to support in default configurations that it makes things
worse.

Cheers,

Dave.
