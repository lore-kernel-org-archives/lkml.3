I guess they *could*, but my general idea is that when we can do
something in the core, we probably should, because then we're not
depending on all the drivers to do the right thing.  So I would turn
this around and say "we need a pretty good reason to move something
out of the core and into the drivers."

A lot of the issues in the shutdown path are related to getting the
device to shut up so it doesn't cause problems with kexec.  So it does
seem like a good idea to have pci_device_shutdown() disable MSI to
remove one source of bothersome interrupts.

I don't see anything in device_shutdown() that would wait for this
sort of asynchronous shutdown to complete.  So how do we know it's
finished before we turn off the power, reset, kexec, etc.?

If we need to do asynchronous shutdown, it seems like we need some
sort of driver core infrastructure to manage that.
