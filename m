Call it what you will. :)

The other half of the benchmark (the threaded case) looks _completely_
different since it's dominated by per-mm VM structures while doing page
faults.

And, yes, I probably shouldn't be calling xfs "newer".

Click on the little "Linear scaling" checkbox.  That's what I _want_ it
to do.  It's completely unscientific, but I _expected_ xfs to do better
than ext4 here.

The storage is a piddly little laptop disk.  If I do this on a
ramfs-hosted loopback, the things actually looks the same (or even a wee
bit worse).  The reason is that nobody is waiting on the disk to finish
any of the writeback (we're way below the dirty limits), so we're not
actually limited by the storage.

Oh, I didn't mean to be spilling secrets here or anything.  I'm
obviously not a filesystem developer and I have zero deep understanding
of what the difference in overhead of the write paths is.  It confused
me, so I reported it.
