The server permission checks the OPEN, this only affects the subsequent ACCESS.

The server will fail the OPEN with NFS4_ERR_ACCESS if the open is for read/write and the file has write-execute permission.

See the test program I subsequently posted. The program demonstrates that open O_RDWR on a mode=0333 file fails as expected. (Tested on both Ganesha and knfsd).
