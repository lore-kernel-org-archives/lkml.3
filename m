Hole punch doesn't change the offsets of subsequent extents in the
file - it leaves a hole. This doesn't leave a hole at all - all the 
extents above the range are shifted down to offset where the extents
being punched out started.

Not necessarily. Video codecs are encapsulated in a container that
can be used to link key frames together so you can do this sort of
manipulation of the file contents and just change an
offset-to-next-keyframe value in the container and it all just
works. Non linear editting (NLE) software has been doing this
manually for 15 years by copying data around - this just optimises
the operation by manipulating the extent mapping rather than needing
to physically copy the data.

FWIW, I've heard persistent rumors going back several years of
various DVR companies shipping equivalent ioctl-based functionality
for XFS filesystems to both insert and remove chunks in video
streams, but I've never been able to find the code for it anywhere.

Hence, at minimum, this should be a fallocate() operation, not a ext4
specific ioctl as it is relatively trivial to implement on most
extent based filesystems.

However, My conditions for merging such functionality into fallocate
are:
	1. it needs xfs_io support [to provide]
	2. comprehensive xfstests coverage, similar to the current
	   hole punch coverage we have.

And have 64 bit file size support, please!

Also FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE is probably a better name for the
operation being done ;)

Cheers,
