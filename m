Audit does not have its own namespace (yet).  That idea is being
considered, but we would prefer to avoid it if it makes sense to tie it
in with an existing namespace.  The pid and user namespaces, being
heierarchical seem to make the most sense so far, but we are proceeding
very carefully to avoid creating a security nightmare in the process.

>From the kernel's perspective, none of the namespaces have a name.  A
container concept of a group of namespaces may have been assigned one,
but that isn't apparent to the layer that is logging this information.

There would certainly need to be a way to tie these namespace
identifiers to container names in log messages.
