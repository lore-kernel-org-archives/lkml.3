The current problem case is only I/O port accesses, so we only have to
support 1/2/4-byte accesses, and I don't think write combining is an
issue.  But it still sounds like COW might be trying to force a square
peg into a round hole.  Maybe there are other approaches.  I just
thought of .mmap() because that's already used for MEM space accesses.
