Hello,
  Here is the next revision of Mailbox framwork.

Changes since v5:
 o Use standard error types instead of special type mbox_result.
 o Constify client struct in request_channel
 o Use reinit_completion instead of init_completion every time.
 o Improve commentary in bindings and code.

Changes since v4:
 o Common DT binding for Controller and Client drivers
    As a result, discard string based channel matching
 o Provide for an atomic 'peek' api, that a client could
    call to trigger the controller driver push data upwards.
 o OMAP and Highbank conversion to new api is left out, which
    can be converted later by the developers.

Changes since v3:
 o Change name of symbols from ipc to mbox
 o Return real types instead of void *
 o Align structures
 o Change some symbol names
	rxcb -> rx_callback
	txcb -> tx_done
 o Added kernel-doc for exported API
 o Dropped the cl_id and use clients pointer for callbacks.
 o Fixed locking of channel pool
 o Return negative error code for unsuccessful ipc_send_message()
 o Module referencing during mailbox assignment to a client.
 o Made error code symbols specific to mailbox.

Thanks
Jassi
