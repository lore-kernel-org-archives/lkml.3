Subject: [PATCH v3 3/5] mm: Notify filesystems when it's time to apply a deferred cmtime update
Date: Fri, 16 Aug 2013 16:22:10 -0700
Message-Id: <ec267e95fd21891986373c7af1c72b4c8b507332.1376679411.git.luto@amacapital.net>

Filesystems that defer cmtime updates should update cmtime when any
of these events happen after a write via a mapping:

 - The mapping is written back to disk.  This happens from all kinds
   of places, all of which eventually call ->writepages.

 - munmap is called or the mapping is removed when the process exits

 - msync(MS_ASYNC) is called.  Linux currently does nothing for
   msync(MS_ASYNC), but POSIX says that cmtime should be updated some
   time between an mmaped write and the subsequent msync call.
   MS_SYNC calls ->writepages, but MS_ASYNC needs special handling.

Filesystmes that defer cmtime updates should flush them on munmap or
exit.  Finding out that this happened through vm_ops is messy, so
add a new address space op for this.

It's not strictly necessary to call ->flush_cmtime after ->writepages,
but it simplifies the fs code.  As an optional optimization,
filesystems can call mapping_test_clear_cmtime themselves in
->writepages (as long as they're careful to scan all the pages first
-- the cmtime bit may not be set when ->writepages is entered).

This patch does not implement the MS_ASYNC case; that's in the next
patch.
