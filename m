Recently I attended an interesting talk about this subject in which it 
was proposed not only to bypass the kernel for access to high-IOPS 
devices but also to allow byte-addressability for block devices. The 
slides that accompanied that talk can be found here (includes a 
performance comparison with the traditional block driver API):

Bernard Metzler, On Suitability of High-Performance Networking API for 
Storage, OFA Int'l Developer Workshop, April 24, 2013 
(http://www.openfabrics.org/ofa-documents/presentations/doc_download/559-on-suitability-of-high-performance-networking-api-for-storage.html).

This approach leaves the choice of whether to use polling or an 
interrupt-based completion notification to the user of the new API, 
something the Linux InfiniBand RDMA verbs API already allows today.
