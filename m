  BTW, given you always see the problem when ext4_truncate() gets called 
as a response to application catching a deadly signal and thus
task_work_run() gets called, I think there's something in irq_fpu_usable()
which isn't exactly right. But I know nothing about the logic there. Or
maybe the signal is caught in some unlucky moment when FPU is in some
strange state?
