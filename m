It doesn't prevent it, but it _does_ put it in the exact same place as PSCSI 
regarding the warnings on the wiki. It means that if someone wants to 
implement (say) the optical disc or OSD CDBs, they then lose out on ALUA &co 
unless they implement it themselves - which seems unnecessary and painful, 
since those should really be disjoint. In particular, an OSD backed by RADOS 
objects could be a very nice thing indeed, _and_ could really benefit from 
ALUA.
