Sorry, but it seems that we have implemented this algorithm that tries
to reclaim all extents except delayed extent from a particular inode.

Let me describe it, please.  When we access extent status tree of a
particular inode, this inode will be moved into the tail of LRU list
(sbi->s_es_lru).  When we try to reclaim some extents, we will traverse
this list, and reclaim all extents except delayed extent from this
inode until the number of reclaimed objects is equal to 'nr_to_scan' or
all extents has been discarded.

BTW, I have a patch to avoid traverse all entries in LRU list to speed
up this process.

I have a new patch to implement it.  But as I measure it using 'perf
top', there is no any improvement.  I see that the spin lock burns about
1.3% CPU time in my desktop with 2 Intel CPUs.  Maybe a x86 server with
8 CPUs could highlight this improvement.

Yes, I will give this a try.

Yes, but as you said, we need to measure the benefit from it.

To be honest, it is difficulty for us to add a new flag in
fadvise/madvise because other file systems might not provide this hint,
and app A using this hint could affect app B as you described.  But I
agree with you that we could provide a interface to let application
manage extent cache.
