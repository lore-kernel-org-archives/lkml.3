stop_all_queued() is doing hrtimer_cancel(), del_timer_sync()
or tasklet_kill() on all the scsi_cmnd objects that are
"in play". Unless another mechanism calls the .eh_abort_handler
entry point reliably on each "in play" command then the module
cannot be removed. That is because some timer expiry callbacks
are pending.

The only other call to stop_all_queued() is from the
.eh_host_reset_handler entry point.
