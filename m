No, unified hierarchy would be an optional thing for quite a while.

Again, it'll be an opt-in thing.  The hierarchy controller would be
able to notice that and issue warnings if it wants to.

New interface is being added and new features will be added only for
the new interface.  The old one will eventually be deprecated and
removed, but that *years* away.

I don't know.  You can probably hack around some of the most serious
problems but the whole thing isn't built for proper delgation and
that's not the direction the upstream kernel is headed at the moment.

As I've said multiple times, there sure are things that you cannot
achieve without orthogonal multiple hierarchies, but given the options
we have at hands, compromising inside a unified hierarchy seems like
the best trade-off.  Please take a step back from the immediate detail
and think of the general hierarchical organization of workloads.  If
DTF / non-DTF is a fundamental part of your workload classfication,
that should go above.

I don't really understand your example anyway because you can classify
by DTF / non-DTF first and then just propagate cpuset settings along.
You won't lose anything that way, right?

Again, in general, you might not be able to achieve *exactly* what
you've been doing, but, an acceptable compromise should be possible
and not doing so leads to complete mess.

No, it's not "it's hard to make it work".  It's more "it's
fundamentally broken".  You can't identify a resource to be belonging
to a cgroup independent of who's looking at the resource.

It means that you'll be able to ignore subtrees depending on
controllers.

Some of memcg and blkcg people in infra kernel team.

No, what I meant was that unified hierarchy won't break the multiple
hierarchy support immediately.

I wrote about that many times, but here are two of the problems.

* There's no way to designate a cgroup to a resource, because cgroup
  is only defined by the combination of who's looking at it for which
  controller.  That's how you end up with tagging the same resource
  multiple times for different controllers and even then it's broken
  as when you move resources from one cgroup to another, you can't
  tell what to do with other tags.

  While allowing obscene level of flexibility, multiple hierarchies
  destroy a very fundamental concept that it *should* provide - that
  of a resource container.  It can't because a "cgroup" is undefined
  under multiple hierarchies.

* The level of flexibility makes it very difficult to scope the common
  usage models.  It's a problem for both the kernel and userland.  The
  kernel has to be prepared to cope with anything - e.g. with unified
  hierarchy, we can assume things like either all tasks in a cgroup
  are frozen or not, with multiple, any combination is possible - and
  the userland is generally lost on what to do and has been in a
  complete disarray, and it's not really userland's fault because
  enforcing any rule would mean hindering some crazy setup that
  someone is using.

cgroup as it currently stands invites pretty insane usages which we
can't back out of later on.  Well, it's already painful to back out
but the sooner the better.  And all that for what?  Allowing exotic
specialized configurations which in all likelihood will be served
acceptably with unified hierarchy anyway?

I'm making the changes as soon as possible.  There of course are two
steps involved here - implementing the new thing and then removing the
old thing.  Implementing the new thing is gonna happen, hopefully, in
a year's timeframe.  The latter.  I don't know for sure but probably
over five years.

It's gonna be properly maintained but new features in general will
only be implemented for the unified hierarchy.  In time, hopefully,
the difference in capabilities between the new and old interfaces
combined with other efforts will drive users towards the new
interface.  After the old interface's usage has sufficiently dwindled,
it will be deprecated.

Thanks.
