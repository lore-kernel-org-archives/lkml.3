You are right, today that's true technically because IIRC due to Sparc 
quirks we happen to return 'flags' as a return value - still it's very 
ugly and it could break anytime if we decide to do more aggressive 
optimizations and actually directly save into 'flags'.

Note that even today there's a narrow exception: on UP we happen to 
build it the other way around, so that we do:

	local_irq_save(global_flags);
	__acquire(lock);

This does not matter for any real code because on UP there is no 
physical lock and __acquire() is empty code-wise, but any compiler 
driven locking analysis tool using __attribute__ __context__(), if 
built on UP, would see the unsafe locking pattern.

Thanks,
