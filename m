When I read that paragraph, my interpretation is that OPEN (and READ) should be permission checked normally, however, if ONLY execute permission is granted, and the OPEN is read only (and READ of course is read only) then permission would be granted for the purpose of execution. But if any other combination of bits was allowed, then the paragraph doesn't apply. Thus an OPEN SHARE_ACCESS_READ | SHARE_ACCESS_WRITE must fail since write access was not granted (if it was, the exception doesn't apply to my reading).

The trouble is if we require the ACCESS to always be used to distinguish read from execute, we have no way of allowing an open("foo", O_CREAT, 0) system call.

It's a real shame we don't have a SHARE_ACCESS_EXECUTE so we wouldn't have to have the exception for OPEN...

Another option would be to have some hint that the OPEN was responsible for creating the file (in which case the ACCESS results could be ignored), but that's more protocol wishful thinking (and not so easy for the server to implement).
