Good point!  Given that a process can run with a new user namespace and
no other namespaces, and then drop all its other privileges that way,
the ability to drop privileges without using a user namespace seems
completely harmless, with one exception that you noted:

Sigh, bad sudo.  Sure, restricting this to no_new_privs only seems fine.
I'll do that in v2, and document that in the manpage.
