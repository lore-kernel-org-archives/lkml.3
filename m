Why not implement only the last flag only as  the first step?  It seems
like the simplest one.  So I think that would mean:

	- no worrying about cancelling, etc.
	- apps should be told to pass the entire range at once (normally
	  the whole file).
	- The NFS server probably shouldn't do the internal copy loop by
	  default.

We can't prevent some storage system from implementing a high-latency
copy operation, but we can refuse to provide them any help (providing no
progress reports or easy way to cancel) and then they can deal with the
complaints from their users.

Also, I don't get the first option above at all.  The argument is that
it's safer to have more copies?  How much safety does another copy on
the same disk really give you?  Do systems that do dedup provide
interfaces to turn it off per-file?

In fact maybe that's the only case to care about on the first pass.

But I understand that Zach's tired of the woodshedding and I could live
with the above I guess....
