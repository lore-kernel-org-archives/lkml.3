Is this the sort of thing that you expect to see when GFP_NOFS |
GFP_NOFAIL type allocations continualy fail?

http://oss.sgi.com/archives/xfs/2013-12/msg00095.html

XFS doesn't use GFP_NOFAIL, it does it's own loop with GFP_NOWARN in
kmem_alloc() so that if we get stuck for more than 100 attempts to
allocate it throws a warning. i.e. only when we really are stuck and
reclaim is not making any progress.

This specific case is due to memory fragmentation preventing a 64k
memory allocation (due to the filesystem being configured with a 64k
directory block size), but GFP_NOFS | GFP_NOFAIL allocations happen
*all the time* in filesystems.

There be dragons. If memcg's deadlock in low memory conditions in
the presence of GFP_NOFS | GFP_NOFAIL allocations, then we need to
make the memcg reclaim design more robust, not work around it by
allowing filesystems to drain critical memory reserves needed for
other situations....

Cheers,

Dave.
