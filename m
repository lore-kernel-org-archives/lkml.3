It happens in fs/kernfs/dir.c:kernfs_drain().  That routine is called 
when a sysfs file is removed, and it waits until all ongoing read/write 
operations are finished.

The proper lock is dev->mutex, as I mentioned in an earlier email 
(http://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=142176669519982&w=2).  That lock is 
held whenever a ->remove method is called.
