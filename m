So this means svc_delete_xprt was called on an xprt twice.

That could happen if server threads are still running (and calling
svc_recv) after we start shutting down the server: svc_shutdown_net
assumes that server threads are already shut down, but that isn't true
any more after the containerization work.

I thought that would only be a bug for users actually running multiple
containers, but looking at nfs_callback_down, I don't think that's
true--it seems to always shut down the thread last.
