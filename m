Pretty much any system call that you could conceive of writing a
userspace without.

There's a partial project list at https://tiny.wiki.kernel.org/projects.

Yes, precisely.  We're talking about embedded systems small enough that
you're booting with init=/your/app and don't even call fork(), where you
know exactly what code you're putting in and what libraries you use.
And they're almost certainly not running glibc.

Right.  For reference, we're talking about kernels where the *total*
size is a few hundred kB.

> How much storage space do embedded systems have nowadays?

For the embedded systems we're targeting for the tinification effort, in
a first pass: 512k-2M of storage (often for an *uncompressed* kernel, to
support execute-in-place), and 128k-512k of memory.  We've successfully
built useful kernels and userspaces for such environments, and we'd like
to go even smaller.
