So I did some googling and found in QNX servers create a channel
to receive messages, and clients connect to this channel.
Multiple clients can connect to the channel.
But it is not a bus -- no multicast/broadcast, and no name
service or policy rules like D-Bus has.  To me it looks
to be similar in functionality to UNIX domain sockets.

My guess is that the people porting from QNX were just confused
and their use of D-Bus was in error.  Maybe they should've used
plain sockets, capnproto, ZeroMQ or whatever.

Well, IMHO you got it backwards.  Before adding a complex new IPC
API to the kernel you should do the homework and gather some
evidence that there will be enough users to justify the addition.

But maybe I misunderstood the purpose of this thread and you're
just advertising it to find possible users instead of already
suggesting to merge it?  If someone has some convincing story
to share why kdbus would solve their IPC needs, I'm all ears.

(I'm sorry this implies your responses so far were not convincing:
not verifiable facts, no numbers, no testimonials etc.)

FWIW, my gut feeling was that the earlier attempts to add a new
IPC primitve like multicast UNIX domain sockets
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1255575/focus=1257999
were a much saner approach.  But now I think the comments
from this old thread have not been addressed, instead the
new approach just made the thing more complex and
put in ipc/ instead of net/ to bypass the guards.


Thanks,
Johannes
