For /proc/*/stat: check permissions when opening.  If the opener
passes the ptrace check, set a flag in file->private_data indicating
that this struct file has permission.

For /proc/*/maps: either fail the open if the check fails or set a
flag that causes the resulting struct file to be useless.

Apparently not.  I haven't looked at the code, but I just tried it.
The fd from /proc/<pid>/maps survives an exec of the process it's
pointing at.  That means that either the mm changing has no effect on
the struct file or that an unshared mm survives exec.
