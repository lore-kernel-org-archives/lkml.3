Unfortunately it is like a regression which we missed
due to s390x and ppc is not well tested.

Ohh that is sad. Unfortunately I can't reproduce this on my own
environment. I have power mac pro G5 but w/o graphics card, so i cant
install linux on it. If you know how to do that w/o monitor please let
me know.

So you just do bunch of writes/mmap to fallocated area.
The only guess I have is that some bug in extent status tree

Please run test with a patch which was posted here:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=136455173926544&w=2
This patch enable sanity checks for extent_status tree.
Also please try following patch. It voluntary disable es_lookup functionality.
