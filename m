Subject: [PATCH 0/2] new API to allocate buffer-cache for superblock in non-movable
 area

Hello,

This patch try to solve problem that a long-lasting page cache of
ext4 superblock disturbs page migration.

I've been testing CMA feature on my ARM-based platform
and found some pages for page caches cannot be migrated.
Some of them are page caches of superblock of ext4 filesystem.

Current ext4 reads superblock with sb_bread(). sb_bread() allocates page
from movable area. But the problem is that ext4 hold the page until
it is unmounted. If root filesystem is ext4 the page cannot be migrated forever.

I introduce a new API for allocating page from non-movable area.
It is useful for ext4 and others that want to hold page cache for a long time.

I have 2 patchs:

1. Patch 1/2: introduce a new API that create page cache from non-movable area
2. Patch 2/2: have ext4 use the new API to read superblock

This patchset is based on linux-next-20140717.

Thanks a lot.
