  OK, there were some changes to orphan list locking in 3.17-rc1. If I
screwed up it could cause orphan list corruption. But for now I don't think
that's the issue.

  No. We first finish all modifications to the fs and only after that clean
up the journal. So that makes all changes to the fs protected.
