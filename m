Of course you're right, and Miklos had pointed this out already and I
forgot to update the changelog.  Apologies!

Yes, except: won't a local filesystem will still hit this case on a
filesystem that's corrupted to link a directory into multiple parents?

Though in that case arguably the right behavior might be, say, WARN and
return -EIO.

Agreed, I'll fix and resend.

Though now I wonder whether it's worth keeping two different interfaces,
one for the case when finding a parent in a different directory is an
error and one for the case when it's normal and you'd just like it fixed
up.

(Then one remaining thing I don't understand is how to make that fixing
up reliable.  Or is there some reason nobody hits the _EBUSY case of
__d_unalias?)

--b.
