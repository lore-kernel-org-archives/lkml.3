Thanks for attaching the thread. Was very educative! I still do not 
quite understand - will umount() still work when 
inode_permission()[->getattr()] on the ancestors fail (with ESTALE 
etc.)? Wouldn't path resolution itself abort and fail and therefore 
do_umount() never called? I understand that the path to the mountpoint 
being reachable through the dentry chain is a necessity for umounting, 
but is just that really sufficient?
