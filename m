I'd rather avoid having to keep around a bunch of extra per-device
state, and having to send all opcodes out to user-space first is messy.

It's unclear how effective this will ultimately be, given that some
different standards include EVPD and/or mode pages specific to the
peripheral type.

This is overly complex, and defining the groups of opcodes is
problematic to maintain.

Passthrough mode set at creation is the correct default, but grouping
things by SCSI spec and custom opcode groupings doesn't really make alot
of sense to me.

This hurts flexibility, given that some folks might already have their
own ALUA implemented in a user-space driver, and would like to be able
to run in pure passthrough mode.

So I'd still like to start for an initial merge with the two different
modes mentioned earlier.  The pure-passthrough mode where everything is
handled by user-space, and an I/O passthrough mode where only
SCF_SCSI_DATA_CDB is passed along to userspace, but all other control
CDBs are handled by existing in-kernel emulation.

Andy, can you re-spin a series with these two approaches in mind..?
