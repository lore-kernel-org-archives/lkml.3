As a general note for this patch series, you could really benefit
from a cover letter that describes the symptoms and all the different
issues you found.

Also, please title your patches based on the context of the patch.
Giving them all the same title is very confusing and at quick glance
makes appear that the same patch was applied 3 times.

What if the tsn you are currently processing will advance the
CUM TSN?  You may still need to eneter PD.  This is why
sctp_eat_data() is not the right place to place this check.

The more I look at the SCTP_CMD_PART_DELIVERY the more I am thinking 
that it has to come after the current TSN has been delivered to the 
queue.  That way, if we are currently processing the first fragment, 
we'll queue it, then enter PD and pull it off the queue properly.
If we are processing the middle or last, it will get queued first, and
then PD will be entered to fetch anything that we can fetch.

In fact, the above is what happens when we issue a RENEGE command, but 
the order is reversed is RENEGE is skipped for some reason.  I am still
trying to figure out if it's possible to enter PD without RENEGE, but I 
did notice the above aberration.

This may still allow you to skip over a gap if the first middle fragment 
in the queue starts after the gap.  We need to make sure that
TSN of the current chunk is less then equal to sctp_tsnmap_get_ctsn(map).

Same thing here.  Both, FIRST and MIDDLE fragments need to be validated
against sctp_tsnmap_get_ctsn(), otherwise you may be stepping over a gap.

I am not sure this hunk is really needed.

You are trying to use this code make sure that you start PD with 
something to deliver, but the PD code already takes care of that.
You also get some basic cum_tsn checking for the current chunk because
of how renege is called, but you still don't do the checks for 
subsequent chunks in the queue as I stated above, so you are still
subject to possible hangs.
