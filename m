Well, we figure that most applications won't be using append only
inode flags for files that they know they want to edit at random
offsets later on. ;)

However, I can see how DVR apps would use open(O_APPEND) to obtain
the fd they write to because that sets the write position to the EOF
on every write() call (i.e. in generic_write_checks()). And collapse
range should behave sanely with this sort of usage.

e.g. XFS calls generic_write_checks() after it has taken the IO lock
to set the current write position to EOF. Hence it will be correctly
serialised against collapse range calls and so O_APPEND writes will
not leave sparse holes if collapse range calls are interleaved with
the write stream....

Cheers,

Dave.
