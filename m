Elsewhere I've recommended such things are placed in the DTB by the
bootloader (at least for those cases where the bootlaoder is tied to the
firmware), as it can fill in the appropriate enable-method (and add any
other nodes as required).

Having compatible = "arm,psci", and a couple of other properties for now
is certainly preferable to describing a not-yet-implemented PSCI 0.2.

Thanks,
Mark.
