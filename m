Subject: [PATCH 14/14] cgroup: RCU protect each cgroup_subsys_state release

With the planned unified hierarchy, individual css's will be created
and destroyed dynamically across the lifetime of a cgroup.  To enable
such usages, css destruction is being decoupled from cgroup
destruction.  Most of the destruction path has been decoupled but the
actual free of css still depends on cgroup free path.

When all css refs are drained, css_release() kicks off
css_free_work_fn() which puts the cgroup.  When the cgroup refcnt
reaches zero, cgroup_diput() is invoked which in turn schedules RCU
free of the cgroup.  After a grace period, all css's are freed along
with the cgroup itself.

This patch moves the RCU grace period and css freeing from cgroup
release path to css release path.  css_release(), instead of kicking
off css_free_work_fn() directly, schedules RCU callback
css_free_rcu_fn() which in turn kicks off css_free_work_fn() after a
RCU grace period.  css_free_work_fn() is updated to free the css
directly.

The five-way punting - percpu ref kill confirmation, a work item,
percpu ref release, RCU grace period, and again a work item - is quite
hairy but the work items are there only to provide process context and
the actual sequence is kill confirm -> release -> RCU free, which
isn't simple but not too crazy.

This removes cgroup_css() usage after offline_css() allowing clearing
cgroup->subsys[] from offline_css(), which makes it consistent with
online_css() and brings it closer to proper lifetime management for
individual css's.
