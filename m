Yeah, this is from a patch in cgroup/review-post-kernfs-conversion
branch which updates cgroup to use pr_cont_kernfs_name().  I forget
that cgrp->kn is NULL for the dummy_root's top cgroup and thus it ends
up calling the kernfs functions with NULL kn and thus the oops.  I
posted an updated patch and the git branch has been updated.

So, nothing to do with btrfs and it looks like somehow the test
appratus is mixing up branches?

Thanks!
