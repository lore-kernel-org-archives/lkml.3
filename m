Roland,
So what kind of signal was leading to your "stomping on the memory"?
Was it user generated or something like SIGIO, SIGPIPE or a RT signal?

To get around the SG_IO ioctl restart problem (for non idempotent
SCSI commands) could we replace a -ERESTARTSYS return value
with -EINTR ?

As I noted in a previous post, for robust user space code using the
SG_IO ioctl, masking signals during the IO may help.


And what about bsg? Is it any better or worse than sg in the case
of interrupted SG_IO ioctls? Apart from the interface (sg_io_hdr
v3 versus v4) it should be a drop in replacement for sg.
