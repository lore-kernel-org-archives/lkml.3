  Not quite. We could use __percpu_counter_add() to set batch size for each
operation depending on the current counter value. But still we don't want
any cpu-local count to go negative (as then we cannot rely on global
counter to give us a lower bound on number of free blocks). Also stealing
from different cpu needs to be implemented...

  Where exactly? I'd be happy to be inspired :).
