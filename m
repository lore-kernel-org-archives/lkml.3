Do we need to be perfect, or just "good enough"?

For a RAID card I expect it would be related to chunk size or stripe
width or something...but even then I would expect to be able to cap it
at 100MB or so.  Or are there storage systems on really fast interfaces
that could legitimately want a hundred meg of data at a time?

Yep, in all three wonky cases so far "optimal_io_size" ended up as 
4294966784, which is 0xfffffe00.  Does something mask out the lower bits?
