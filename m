Thanks to you for your hard work.

In kernel/cpuset.c:quiesce_cpuset() you are using the function
'smp_call_function_any' which asks CPU cores in 'cpumask' to
execute the functions 'hrtimer_quiesce_cpu' and 'timer_quiesce_cpu'.

In the case above, 'cpumask' corresponds to core 0. Since I'm forcing
the call to be executed from core 1 (by using taskset),
an inter-processor interrupt is sent to core 0 for those functions
to be executed.

Ok, thank you! I see that you have already fixed the problem. I tested
your tree on ARM and now it seems to work correctly.

See my reply above.
