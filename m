Subject: [PATCH v4 5/6] memcg: further simplify mem_cgroup_iter

mem_cgroup_iter basically does two things currently. It takes care of
the house keeping (reference counting, raclaim cookie) and it iterates
through a hierarchy tree (by using cgroup generic tree walk).
The code would be much more easier to follow if we move the iteration
outside of the function (to __mem_cgrou_iter_next) so the distinction
is more clear.
This patch doesn't introduce any functional changes.
