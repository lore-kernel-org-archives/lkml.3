Why that and not the time to run the test?

Maybe what you're doing is right, but measuring total time seems more
realistic and simpler, and less likely to accumulate errors.

If we're measuring individual calls I think I'd rather see mean and
variance of the time of individual calls instead of of the sum.

It might also be interested to see how this changes as the number of
cores varies.  (Could you do that by pinning the test threads to some
subset of the 32 cores?)

Admittedly the difference seems clear enough already....  But it'd be
interesting to see how we scale with the new code in addition to just
seeing that's in an improvement.

(And, nit: round these numbers a little?:)

I guess deadlock detection is the most likely explanation of the
difference between the posix and flock cases?

If so that'd make a pretty strong case for eliminating (or somehow
greatly reducing) the deadlock detection.

With /proc/locks using a percpu lock and everything else a per-file
lock, in theory the deadlock detectionis the only thing that should
cause contention between cores, so the test should scale perfectly in
the flock case.  (Might be interesting to confirm that by looking at how
it changes over # of cores.)
