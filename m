Hi Linus,

   Please pull these XFS updates for 3.14-rc1.  This is primarily bug fixes,
   many of which you already have.  New stuff includes a series to decouple the
   in-memory and on-disk log format, helpers in the area of inode clusters, and
   i_version handling.

   We decided to try to use more topic branches this release, so there are some
   merge commits in there on account of that.  I'm afraid I didn't do a good
   job of putting meaningful comments in the first couple of merges.  Sorry
   about that.  I think I have the hang of it now.

Thanks,
     Ben

xfs: update for v3.14-rc1

For 3.14-rc1 there are fixes in the areas of remote attributes, discard,
growfs, memory leaks in recovery, directory v2, quotas, the MAINTAINERS
file, allocation alignment, extent list locking, and in
xfs_bmapi_allocate.  There are cleanups in xfs_setsize_buftarg, removing
unused macros, quotas, setattr, and freeing of inode clusters.  The
in-memory and on-disk log format have been decoupled, a common helper to
calculate the number of blocks in an inode cluster has been added, and
handling of i_version has been pulled into the filesystems that use it.

- cleanup in xfs_setsize_buftarg
- removal of remaining unused flags for vop toss/flush/flushinval
- fix for memory corruption in xfs_attrlist_by_handle
- fix for out-of-date comment in xfs_trans_dqlockedjoin
- fix for discard if range length is less than one block
- fix for overrun of agfl buffer using growfs on v4 superblock filesystems
- pull i_version handling out into the filesystems that use it
- don't leak recovery items on error
- fix for memory leak in xfs_dir2_node_removename
- several cleanups for quotas
- fix bad assertion in xfs_qm_vop_create_dqattach
- cleanup for xfs_setattr_mode, and add xfs_setattr_time
- fix quota assert in xfs_setattr_nonsize
- fix an infinite loop when turning off group/project quota before user
  quota
- fix for temporary buffer allocation failure in xfs_dir2_block_to_sf
  with large directory block sizes
- fix Dave's email address in MAINTAINERS
- cleanup calculation of freed inode cluster blocks
- fix alignment of initial file allocations to match filesystem geometry
- decouple in-memory and on-disk log format
- introduce a common helper to calculate the number of filesystem
  blocks in an inode cluster
- fixes for extent list locking
- fix for off-by-one in xfs_attr3_rmt_verify
- fix for missing destroy_work_on_stack in xfs_bmapi_allocate
