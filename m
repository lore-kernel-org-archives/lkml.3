But it has no effect if the pointer was changed _after_ rmb() was already
called.

And, you need a barrier _after_ ACCESS_ONCE().

(Unless, again, we know that this is the first filter, but this is only
 by accident).

I think smp_store_release() should be moved from seccomp_attach_filter()
to seccomp_sync_threads(). Although probably it _should_ work either way,
but at least this looks confusing because a) "current" doesn't need a
barrier to serialize wuth itself, and b) it is not clear why it is safe
to change the pointer dereferenced by another thread without a barrier.

As I said smp_read_barrier_depends() (nop unless alpha) or
smp_load_acquire() which you used in the previous version.

And to remind, afaics smp_load_acquire() in put_filter() should die ;)
