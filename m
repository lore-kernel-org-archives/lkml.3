Maybe we should divide request_module() into several functions regarding
expected caller's privileges?

- request_module() for CAP_SYS_MODULE in init_ns
- request_module_relaxed() for everybody

request_module_relaxed() is used in get_fs_type(), dev_load() and all
places where the safety of module loading is manually checked.  All old
not yet checked users of request_module() will not be triggerable from user_ns.
That's the same scheme as with capable() and ns_capable().
