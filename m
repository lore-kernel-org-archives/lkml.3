Not really.  2.4 did writeback by walking a standalone list of
buffer_heads, without locking their containing page.  I removed all
that and did writeback of the page instead.  That immediately caused
this problem, because the 2.4 writepage held lock_page() across
writeout.  So I changed that to drop lock_page() immediately after
submission and added PG_writeback to flag the under-writeback state. 
The second change went in pretty much immediately - all within the
same 2.5.x release, probably.

Some hard numbers in the changelog would be nice.  Did you try dbench-on-ext2?

Nope, if we can query the mode under /sys then that should be sufficient.
