Thanks for the reply. I've verified that your patch fixes my issue.
And it's absolutely better than my solution.

I have another question about ext2 XIP performance, although it's not
quite related to this thread.

I'm testing xip with ext2 on a ram disk drive, the driver is brd.c.
The RAM disk size is 2GB and I pre-fill it to guarantee that all pages
reside in main memory.
Then I use two different applications to write to the ram disk. One is
open() with O_DIRECT flag, and writing with Posix write(). Another is
open() with O_DIRECT, mmap() it to user space, then use memcpy() to
write data. I use different request size to write data, from 512 bytes
to 64MB.

In my understanding, the mmap version bypasses the file system and
does not go to kernel space, hence it should have better performance
than the Posix-write version. However, my test result shows it's not
always true: when the request size is between 8KB and 1MB, the
Posix-write() version has bandwidth about 7GB/s and mmap version only
has 5GB/s. The test is performed on a i7-3770K machine with 8GB
memory, kernel 3.12. Also I have tested on kernel 3.2, in which mmap
has really bad performance, only 2GB/s for all request sizes.

Do you know the reason why write() outperforms mmap() in some cases? I
know it's not related the thread but I really appreciate if you can
answer my question.

Thanks,
Andiry
