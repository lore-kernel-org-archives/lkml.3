So what will happen when there is not enough space when "inserting a
range" ? And how should user proceed from there ?

There is a fallocate for allocation, so as I already said you can
shift the extents to make a hole in the file and then use fallocate
to allocate space for it and you'll get the same result. You are
basically doing that now as well, but when the allocation fails the
whole "insert range" ioct fails, however the extents are already
shifter and there is already a holi in the file so freeing some
space and running this ioctl again will not help you at all. While
if you fail a fallocate, you can free some space and run it again
without any problems. The result will be as expected.

What I am arguing about is basically that your insert range ioct is
masking two operations as one. Why not to make it transparent and
split it into "shift extents" and fallocate ? Then there is a
question about the name because it's no longer "insert range" but
rather "insert hole" which I think is better and arguably more
useful semantic.
