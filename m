Hello, Paolo.

Ah, okay, if it's something already established, please go ahead.

It's kinda nice to be able to search for the constants for usages in
kernel.  It's not complete but does help from time to time.

How many constants need to be added?  I guess this ties to the other
thread on why it's desirable to add all listed commands.  If you're
just gonna add several, there's no point in not using the constants,
right?  Most are already there.  If you want opcodes visible, you can
make them the comments, right?

Yeah, both sound fine to me.

Let's please not do //.

The cacheline thing was me being confused about how the tables are
used.  The tables are per-device after initialized so it should be
fine.

Maybe I'm misreading the code but we're still initializing table per
queue, right?  Can't we just have per-type tables which are populated
during boot (or on-demand)?

Thanks.
