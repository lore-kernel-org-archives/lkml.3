Is it necessary to also add the q->dev check in the following case?

static void blk_pm_requeue_request(struct request *rq)
{
	if (rq->q->dev && !(rq->cmd_flags & REQ_PM))
		rq->q->nr_pending--;
}

So that we do not have a meanlingless value of nr_pending for those
drivers that don't use block runtime PM, and this also has the benefit
of making those drivers return early.

Thanks,
Aaron
