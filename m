I think that capabilities(7) is largely a disaster.  That aside, I
don't think that all of these capabilities should refer to the
*kernel* privileges.  For example, CAP_SYS_BOOT should be, and remain,
the ability to reboot the system *yourself*.  For example, if someone
wants to implement Windows 7 (or Visa?  Or 2003?  I forget.) style
reboot auditing, then userspace specifically does not want programs
that can ask for a reboot to hold CAP_SYS_BOOT.

I would love to fix this race.  That opens the door to a lot more
debugging (maps, status, etc) while not pretending to offer a kernel
check that doesn't, and can't, exist.

Materializing some sort of pid fd on the receiving end would be one
solution.  Another would be to give the receiver some token that can
be used to check for pid recycling.

Can we give each task a pid-namespace-local 64-bit (or even longer)
number that is mostly guaranteed not to be reused for the lifetime of
the namespace?

For example, give each task a per-pidns tid_unique, and give each
pidns a next_tid_unique.  Creating a task assigns it
next_tid_unique++.  (On overflow, clone fails.)  For CRIU's benefit,
if you have CAP_SYS_ADMIN over the pidns's userns and you are not in
the pidns, then you can change tid_unique and next_tid_unique.  Doing
that carelessly will introduce races, but that's fine -- it should
only be done on restore when everything's frozen.

I much prefer that approach.  If a kernel feature is being added to
just to avoid duplication of a debugging aid in user code, then let's
leave it to user code.
