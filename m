We copied this code from xfs_bunmapi. And we realize that why it is
there because xfs_bunmapi may split the extents, which could require
block allocation for btree, but I think that is not necessary here
because updating starting offsets of extents would not reqire a btree
split and allocation.

Ok, we noted all your points and understand that a lot of work is
really needed to make it stable. we will try to implement them in next
version of patch. Really thanks for your time and help.
