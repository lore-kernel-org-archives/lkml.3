I don't know.  The patch seems confusing to me.  It really is about
adding single lockdep annotation but comes with other changes.  I
don't think it's a big deal either way but at least we wouldn't be
having this %current vs. @tsk conversation which is mostly irrelevant
to the actual proposed change, right?  It really should have been a
separate patch from the beginning.  Just refer to the original commit
and explain what happened?

Thanks.
