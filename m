Yeah, are you ok with a follow on series to clean all these files? I
don't want to make this series longer with something not dma related
that's purely cleanup from the great header reorg of 2012.

Ok, so when I removed the old edma.h it was full of unused defines and
we are left with just this one. If I introduced something like that it
would be used in just one place here. and only for these two values.
How about we just add a comment?

Let me reword the subject/description. The idea of this logical
chunk was to put everything in place to make it build on OMAP,
with the expectation that the build fails without the next patch
in the series.
