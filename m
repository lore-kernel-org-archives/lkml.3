  OK, so I had a second look. And the compiler thinks differently than you
:) The thing is that my gcc (4.3.4) apparently assumes pointer underflow is
undefined and thus optimizes your test &pos->field to 1. I've asked our gcc
guys for a definitive answer but clearly your code will need some way to
avoid pointer underflows...
