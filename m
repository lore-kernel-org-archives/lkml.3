Good idea; I was unhappy with this name too. Done for v11.

Done.

That certainly seems plausible, but for the moment, I want to keep nnp
near seccomp, since that's where we have a race.

I've expanded the comment; it's the same issue as nnp: seccomp could
have changed, so if we gained a mode, we need to set the flag too.

Excellent point. Other kernel users of the _MASK name aren't inverted. Fixed.

Switch argument and comment to "parent".

Done, though I used a BUG_ON since the compiler will optimize it out
(since it's an impossible state to be in).

I can't do this since EFAULT is already used to detect seccomp
capabilities from userspace.

It's not bad. I tripped over sd -> sd_local and the related sd vs &sd
in the SK_RUN_FILTER call, but otherwise it was pretty trivial.

Noted, thanks!
