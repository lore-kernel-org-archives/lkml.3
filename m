Well, it has all the info I need, but the results don't make me too
happy.  Everything I've checked seems consistent, and I don't know why
the host stopped.  The link TRBs are intact, the dequeue pointer for the
endpoint was pointing to the transfer that timed out and it had the
cycle bit set correctly, etc.  Perhaps the no-op TRBs are really the
issue.

I'll have to take a look at the log again tomorrow.  I posted the dmesg
on pastebin if David wants to check it out as well:

Can you send me the output of `sudo lspci -vvv -n`?  Maybe we can just
turn off scatter-gather for your host controller until we get a proper
fix in that uses link TRBs instead of no-op TRBs.
