How is it specific to memcg? The fact only memcg uses the interface
doesn't imply it is memcg specific.

There are other ways to achieve the same. E.g. not ack new usage of
register callback users. We have done similar with other things like
use_hierarchy...

The cleanup is removing 2 callbacks with a cost of moving non-memcg
specific code inside memcg. That is what I am objecting to.

There are pros and cons for both approaches and it should be discussed
in a separate thread with a code to back all the claims.

I will not repeat myself. We seem to disagree on where the code belongs.
As I've said I will not ack this code, try to find somebody else who
think it is a good idea. I do not see any added value.
