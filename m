I think there might be odd corner cases.  For example, mmap a tmpfs
file, write it, and unmap it.  Then, an hour later, maybe the system
will be under memory pressure and page out the file.  This could
trigger a surprising time update.  (I'm not sure this can actually
happen on tmpfs, but maybe it would on some other filesystem.)

Does this actually matter?  A flag to turn the feature on or off would
do the trick, but I don't think there's precedent for sticking a flag
in a_ops.

Whoops -- I assumed that it was safe to recursively take freeze
protection at the same level.

I'm worried about the following race:

Thread 1 (in munmap):
Check AS_CMTIME set
sb_start_pagefault

Thread 2 (freezing the fs):
frozen = SB_FREEZE_PAGEFAULT;
sync_filesystem()

Thread 1 is now stuck.  It doesn't need to be, because sync_filesystem
will flush out the cmtime write.  But there doesn't seem to be a clean
mechanism to wait for the freeze to finish.

Is there a clean way to avoid this?  I don't want to return
immediately if a freeze is in progress, because userspace expects that
munmap will update cmtime synchronously.

And ugly but simple solution is:

if (!mapping_test_cmtime(mapping))
    return;  /* Optimization: nothing to do. */

if (__sb_start_write(mapping->host->i_sb, SB_FREEZE_FS, false)) {
    mapping_flush_cmtime(mapping);
    __sb_end_write(mapping->host->i_sb, SB_FREEZE_FS);
} else {
    /* Freeze is or was in progress.  The part of freezing from
SB_FREEZE_PAGEFAULT through sync_filesystem holds s_umount for write,
so we can wait for it to finish by taking s_umount for read. */
    down_read(&sb->s_umount);
    up_read(&sb->s_umount);
}

Given that this is rather subtle (I've gotten it wrong multiple
times), I'd rather leave it in one place and comment it well.
