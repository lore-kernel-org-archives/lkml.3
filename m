This was only relevant whet udev did the firmware loading. modprobe
would wait for the kernel, which would wait for the firmware loading,
which would wait for modprobe. This is no longer a problem as udev
does not do firmware loading any more.

Correct.

Depending on the number of devices you have, I suppose we could still
exhaust the workers.

Making kmod a special case is of course possible. However, as long as
there is no fundamental reason why kmod should get this special
treatment, this just looks like a work-around to me. We already have a
work-around, which is to increase the global timeout. If you still
think we should do something different in systemd, it is probably best
to take the discussion to systemd-devel to make sure all the relevant
people are involved.
