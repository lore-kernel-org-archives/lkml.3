It's not damaged, this is expected result if you're using old
e2fsprogs which still treats this as an error.

It's not an error because we only update superblock summary at
unmount time so with unclean shutdown it's likely that it does not
match the reality, but e2fsck can and will easily fix that for you.

Please try e2fsprogs v1.42.3 or newer.

Thanks!
