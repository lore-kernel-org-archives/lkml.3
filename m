Hey James,

I think it's because of the cover-letter comment I gave in my initial 
patchset:
"Although these patches involve 3 subsystems with different maintainers 
(scsi, iser, target) I would prefer seeing these patches included together."
The set involved initiator-target wire protocol dependency.

I removed this comment in v1, v2 due to Roland's comment:
"Why? Because they break wire compatibility? I hate to say it but even 
if they're merged at the same time,
you can't guarantee that targets and initiators will be updated together."

So I guess Nic just followed up on my request in order to avoid 
wire-protocol breakage.
I assume the stable tag was there for the same reason.

Anyway, Sorry for all the fuss... I'll try to avoid such mistakes in the 
future.

Sagi.
