Thanks for detailed explanation. So, there's already a feature in crash utility
to address relocation!, though it's better for me to try them to check if it's
really applicable to this feature. My concern is whether --reloc works well
on x86_64 too, because relocation has never done on x86_64 ever, right?

Another concern is that in case of relocation, users need to additional information
regarding runtime symbol information to crash utility. I want to avoid additional
process, automation is preferable if possible.

I guess it's enough if there's runtime symbol addresses because we can get relocated
offset value by comparing it with the compile-time symbol address contained in
a given debuginfo file. Candidates for such symbols are the ones contained in
VMCOREINFO note containing some symbol values for makedumpfile to refer to mm-related
objects in kernel, which is always contained in vmcore generated by current kdump and
also vmcores converted by makedumpfile from it. How about this idea?
