I do agree that this pattern is not safe, that is why I decided to ask.

But, unless I missed something, with the current implementation
spin_lock_irqsave(lock, global_flags) does:

	unsigned long local_flags;

	local_irq_save(local_flags);
	spin_lock(lock);

	global_flags = local_flags;

so the access to global_flags is actually serialized by lock.

Yes, I think the same.

Oleg.
