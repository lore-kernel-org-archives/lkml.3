Hi Durgadoss, Rui, all,

Please see some questions inline below from a user space thermal control loop point of view. I should maybe have tagged this as QUESTIONS but relates pretty well to the sysfs documentation so I hope you excuse me for addressing the topic in this thread.

Btw, let me introduce myself as this is my first appearance on the list: I work on ST-Ericsson with thermal SW architecture in our mobile platform projects.

Best regards
Mattias Nilsson

I miss some information on not just the API but how the user space control is intended to work. To my understanding user space control is based around the use of the user space governor for notifications on kernel defined trip points (active or passive types only), or will that change by your current work?

The governor is an attribute of the zone rather than the trip points so for me that means that for a sensor that is shared between a kernel control zone and a user space zone, we need two zones defined. Is that correctly understood?

Is it an active decision to have the governor on zone level rather than on a per trip level (also see my below questions)?

With the below, how do user space know which thermal zones that are governed by the user space governor and that may be ok to manipulate trip point temps for (vs potentially kernel managed thermal zones with trip points with RW access on the temp node)?

How do these trip point types relate to user space management (only active/passive really relevant as the user space governor only act on those)? Actually, what is the reason for having a separate management of hot/critical compared to the active/passive governed setup? Couldn't the trip type be encapsulated in the governors (if that is moved to a per trip level and not per zone)? As a newcomer I feel I may have missed something essential here...

Also, I don't see any nodes indicating status ("trip point is active"). So how is user space intended to make use of the notification from the user space governor? Poll all the zones for temp at each notification? Any reason for not implementing something like the alarm nodes in hwmon also in the thermal framework?
