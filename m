Yes, I already did this, not only setuid, capabilities also are handled
See the whole patch, please!


Yes, and speaking about LSMs I've mentioned in my patches and doc, that
the proposed function proc_allow_access() should be used after
ptrace_may_access(). proc_allow_access() is not a replacement for
ptrace_may_access(), it should be used *after* it.

So cap_ptrace_access_check() is called, and before the file->f_cred
checks. The LSM veto is already there.

Don't forget that proc_allow_access() is not for ptracing, it's targeted
to the procfs entries! and who opened the file.



Finally take a look at what you say about: cap_ptrace_access_check()


it does:
1)
if (cred->user_ns == child_cred->user_ns &&
    cap_issubset(child_cred->cap_permitted, cred->cap_permitted))
	return 0

2)
if (ns_capable(child_cred->user_ns, CAP_SYS_PTRACE))
	return 0

    ns_capable() calls security_capable().



And take a look at what I did, Andy please:
[PATCH v2 1/9] procfs: add proc_same_open_cred() to check if the cred
have changed

proc_same_open_cred() returns 1 on success

1) for proc_same_open_cred()
   if (f_cred->user_ns != cred->user_ns)
        return 0

   return (uid_eq(fcred->uid, cred->uid) &&
                  gid_eq(fcred->gid, cred->gid) &&
                  cap_issubset(cred->cap_permitted, f_cred->cap_permitted));

So it handles the (1) of cap_ptrace_access_check()


If this previous proc_same_open_cred() returns 0 (cred have changed)

goto (2) [PATCH v2 2/9] procfs: add proc_allow_access() to check if
file's opener may access task

proc_allow_access() returns 1 on success


2) It does the uid/gid checks which is complete

   Later it does security_capable() check which will do:
   security_ops->capable(f_cred, ns, cap, SECURITY_CAP_AUDIT);

   Take the old f_cred of file opener and do the capability check
   during this moment, ->read(),->write()

   So LSM support, and if LSM is disabled then we have the cap_capable()
   which will go and check userns and capabilities.


Andy if you see that I've missed something please let me know


So Andy the solution is complete and I think ! can you please recheck

(I'll also recheck it).

As I've demonstrated above, no mess and it's not compilcated, very easy
to support :-)

Thanks Andy
