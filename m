Given that we've had problems getting gfp flags propagated into the
VM code (vmalloc, I'm looking at you!) making the current task
carry the valid memory allocation and reclaim context mask woul dbe
a good idea. That's effectively the problem PF_MEMALLOC_NOIO is
working around, and we've recently added it to XFS to silence all
the lockdep warnings using vm_map_ram in GFP_NOFS contexts have been
causing us....

Better than PF_FSTRANS, that's for sure ;)
