Ummm...  tmpfs stores them in the kernel too - though it can page them out to
swap.

I have altered my big-key implementation to just store small items in an
internal buffer and big items in a tmpfs file.  This means that small items
will use up _less_ kernel memory if they're in a key because they won't require
the overhead of a dentry struct and an inode struct.

Don't forget to add user namespaces into the mix :-/
