Subject: [PATCH v2 0/7] ACPICA: Enable ACPICA prototypes for CONFIG_ACPI=n builds.

This is the last series for ACPICA header inclusion cleanups.
The whole story can be found below:
  1. Unsafe inclusions:
     origin: https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/11/22/510
     merged: https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/12/6/79
  2. Header orders:
     origin: https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/4/8/57
     merged: https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/5/12/111
  3. Header stubs:
     origin: https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/12/18/149
     merged: https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/4/29/716

This patchset contains patches that are parts of the last series sent
before, so it is marked as v2 belonging to the same thread as this series:
  https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/12/18/149

Now we have cleaned up all mis-ordered ACPICA headers and implemented stubs
for ACPICA prototypes (functions, global variables, macros), we finally can
enable ACPICA headers for CONFIG_ACPI=n builds so that all ACPICA defined
types are visible to all kernel source files.

After exposing ACPICA types to all kernel sources, we can also sort the
final wrong <acpi/acpi.h> inclusion out of <linux/sfi_acpi.h>.

This patchset also includes a rule enforcement patch to avoid future
inclusion mistakes.

The patch set has passed a build/boot test on the following machines:
Dell Inspiron Mini 1010 (i386)
HP Compaq 8200 Elite SFF PC (x86-64)
With the following kernel configuration items enabled:
  All drivers/acpi configurations
  All platform drivers
  All ACPI drivers
  4 DRM drivers that implement ACPI opregion
  All buses with ACPI bindings
  All cpufreq configurations
  All xen configurations
  All ACPI table drivers
They are tested twice with CONFIG_ACPI enabled/disabled.

Also allyes/allno/allmod tests are done for ARCH=i386 and ARCH=x86_64.

A boot test has been done to ARCH=x86_64 default configuration and it is
confirmed that the ACPI devices are successfully created under
/sys/bus/acpi/devices when CONFIG_ACPI is enabled.

Lv Zheng (7):
  ACPICA: Linux: Add stub support for Linux specific variables and
    functions.
  ACPICA: Linux: Add stub implementation of ACPICA 64-bit mathematics.
  ACPICA: Linux: Add configuration item to indicate the architecture
    specific support.
  ACPICA: Linux: Allow ACPICA inclusion for CONFIG_ACPI=n builds.
  ACPI/SFI: Fix wrong <acpi/acpi.h> inclusion in SFI/ACPI wrapper -
    table definitions.
  ACPI: Cleanup useless ACPI inclusion.
  ACPI: Add support to force header inclusion rules for <acpi/acpi.h>.
