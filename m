Any chance that the failing machine has threads=y in the suspend.conf file?

Rafael, it appears that swsusp's suspend.c spawns new threads after
calling the SNAPSHOT_FREEZE ioctl.  The PF_NOFREEZE (or the new flag)
will get copied to those new threads, but nothing will clear the flag.
 Should I just assume that the userspace suspend code will kill those
threads before continuing with suspend?  Or maybe add a WARN_ON in the
kernel if any threads besides current have the new flag set when the
suspend ops that assume all of userspace is frozen are called?
