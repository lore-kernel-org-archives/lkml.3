Hello,

v3 - fixed compiler warning
v2 - the driver put in drivers/iio, and
converted using iio facilities as suggested by Graeme.

TWL603[02] GPADC is used to measure battery voltage,
battery temperature, battery presence ID, and could
be used to measure twl603[02] die temperature.
This is used on TI blaze, blaze tablet platforms.

The TWL6030/TWL6032 is a PMIC that has a GPADC with 17/19
channels respectively. Some channels have current
source and are used for measuring voltage drop
on resistive load for detecting battery ID resistance,
or measuring voltage drop on NTC resistors for external
temperature measurements, other channels measure voltage,
(i.e. battery voltage), and have inbuilt voltage dividers,
thus, capable to scale voltage. Some channels are dedicated
for measuring die temperature.

Some channels could be calibrated in 2 points, having
offsets from ideal values in trim registers.

The difference between GPADC in TWL6030 and TWL6032:
- 10 bit vs 12 bit ADC;
- 17 vs 19 channels;
- channels have different purpose(i. e. battery voltage
  channel 8 vs channel 18);
- trim values are interpreted differently.

The driver exports function returning converted value for
requested channels.

Sysfs entries are added to start and read conversion result
in millivolts for chosen channel.

The driver is derived from git://git.omapzoom.org/kernel/omap.git
The original driver's authors and contributors are Balaji T K,
Graeme Gregory, Ambresh K, Girish S Ghongdemath.

The changes to the original driver:
- device tree adaptation;
- drop ioctl support - never been used;
- unified measurement method for both devices;
- get rid of "if (device == X)" code style to data driven;
- drop polling end of conversion and use interrupt instead;
- iio framework is used

Tested with on blaze tablet 2 with OMAP4430(twl6030), and
OMAP4470(twl6032) SOMs.

The patches were tested against 3.10-rc7
