I saw the original patch you linked to earlier in the discussion, and
I agree that for your use case adding a contention test is cleaner and clearer
than other options.

That said, I think this extension is only useful for readers: writers should be
getting their business done and releasing the sem.

Also, I think the comment above the function should be clearer that the lock
must already be held by the caller; IOW, this is not a trylock replacement.
