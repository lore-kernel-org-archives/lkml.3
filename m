Sure, I'm happy to support these patches and future work I plan to do on 
the driver.

What additional responsibilities would come with adding my name the 
MAINTAINERS file?

Perhaps Michael and Sam would be interested in sharing the role, for atari 
and sun3 NCR5380 drivers (?)

I only have hardware to test mac_scsi but I can obtain a Domex DMX3191D 
PCI card on ebay.
