what you mean old kernels here? I saw patch "vfs: Lock in place mounts from more privileged users"
is merged into upstream in linux 3.12-rc1, this is not very old. I think there
are not many userspace processes rely on this feature.

If user think host needs to be secure, he should use MS_LOCK to mount filesystem.
we can't make decison for user.
