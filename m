Agree.

The basic idea behind collapse range is that it does'nt leaves a hole.
And this is achieved by updating starting block of each of the extents
which lies beyond hole.
When we are updating an extent, we are actually moving hole to the
right, towards the last allocated block in the file space.
We continue doing this for each extent and finally when this operation
completes, the hole is gone.
If the file has preallocated extent(s) beyond EOF, something like this=>
hole, extent1, extent2, extent_beyond_EOF1.
And we start updating extents one by one, to nullify the effect of hole=>
STEP1: After updating extent1: extent1, hole, extent2, extent_beyond_EOF1.
STEP2: After updating extent2: extent1, extent2, hole, extent_beyond_EOF1.
STEP3: After updating extent_beyond_EOF1: extent1, extent2,
extent_beyond_EOF1, hole => And this removes hole from the file.
If we stop updating just after extent2, this will not remove hole from
the file space but instead, it will place the hole between EOF and 1st
preallcoated extent beyond EOF as in STEP2.
So, if user does an extending truncate, hole will became visible as it
is still there.

Yes, we could put a restriction on that, something like: if (len +
offset > i_size) { return -EINVAL;}

The EOF file rules are handled in the fs specific patches. As in XFS =>
+       if (mode & FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE) {
+               error = -xfs_collapse_file_space(ip, offset + len, len);
+               if (error || offset >= i_size_read(inode))
+                       goto out_unlock;
+
+               /* Shrink size in case of FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE */
+               if ((offset + len) > i_size_read(inode))
+                       new_size = offset;
+               else
+                       new_size = i_size_read(inode) - len;
+               error = -xfs_update_file_size(ip, new_size);
But it seems ok to not allow (offset + len) > i_size.

Yes, we are currently working on it.
With next version of collapse_range patches, we will also send xfs_io
and xfstests patches and manpage also.

Okay!
