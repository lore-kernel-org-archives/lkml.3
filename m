Yes, this was probably one part that I was least comfortable about.

nfsd does have PF_FSTRANS set in current->flags.  But some other processes
might not.

If any process takes sk_lock, allocates memory, and then blocks in reclaim =
it
could be waiting for nfsd.  If nfsd waits for that sk_lock, it would cause a
deadlock.

Thinking a bit more carefully .... I suspect that any socket that nfsd
created would only ever be locked by nfsd.  If that is the case then the
problem can be resolved entirely within nfsd.  We would need to tell lockdep
that there are two sorts of sk_locks, those which nfsd uses and all the
rest.  That might get a little messy, but wouldn't impact performance.

Is it justified to assume that sockets created by nfsd threads would only
ever be locked by nfsd threads (and interrupts, which won't be allocating
memory so don't matter), or might there be locked by other threads - e.g for
'netstat -a' etc??
