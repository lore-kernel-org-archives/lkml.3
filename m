What I've seen so far seems to indicate that gcc-4.8.2 miscompiles ski,
resulting in kernel oopses, and _possibly_ that gcc-4.7.3 miscompiles
the kernel.  Ski compiled by gcc-4.7.3 (on x86_64) running a kernel
compiled by gcc-4.3.6 seems to be a solid combination for me.

My ski patches are in <http://user.it.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/patches/ia64/ski-1.3.2/>
for now.  I'll post the kernel patches to linux-ia64 @ vger in a few minutes.
