It can similarly be done in SCSI-like interface without need for any middleman.

What you mean is true, but my point is that this abstraction is better to be done in
SCSI, i.e. SAM, manner. Now need to write fields inside of CDBs, it would be pretty
inconvenient ;). But CDBs fields can be fields in some scsi_io structure. Exact opcodes
can be easily abstracted to be filled on the last stage, where end CDB is constructed
from those fields.

Problem with block abstraction is that it is the least common denominator of all block
devices capabilities, hence advanced capabilities, available only some class of
devices, are automatically become "impossible". Hence, it would be more productive
instead to use the most capable abstraction, which is SAM. In this abstraction there's
no need to reinvent complex interfaces and write complex middleman code for every
advanced capability. All advanced capabilities there are available by definition, if
supported by underlying hardware. That's my point.

POSIX is for simple applications, for which read()/write() calls are sufficient. They
are outside of our discussions. But advanced applications need more. I know plenty of
applications issuing direct SCSI commands, but how many can you name applications using
block interface (bsg)? I can recall only one quite relatively used Linux specific
library. That's all. This interface is not demanded by applications.
