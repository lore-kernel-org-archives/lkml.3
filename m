It has to be said that this documentation is terrible.

Jumping "in medias res"[1] is great for fiction, awful for technical
documentation.

I would recommend the Economist Style Guide[2].  They always say
"Barak Obama, President of the United States" the first time he is
mentioned in an article, even though almost everyone knows who Barak
Obama is.

In this case you're leaping into something .. fabrics, LIO,
backstores, target solutions, ... aargh.  Explain what you mean by
each term and how it all fits together.

Thanks,
Rich.
