I agree with you that AIX is at fault, and that the preferable situation
for the linux client would be for AIX to not return NFS4ERR_DELAY in
this use case.  I have attached a simple program that causes exacerbates
the problem on the AIX server.  I have already had a conference call
with AIX NFS development about this issue, where I vehemently tried to
convince them to fix their server.  Unfortunately as I don't have much
reputation in the NFS community, I was unable to convince them to do the
right thing.  I would be more than happy to set up another call, if
someone higher up in the linux NFS hierarchy would be willing to
participate.

That being said, I think implementing an exponential backoff is an
improvement in the client regardless of what AIX is doing.  If a server
needs only 2 seconds to process a request for which NFS4ERR_DELAY was
returned, this algorithm would get the client back and running after
only 2.1 seconds of elapsed time.  Whereas the current dumb algorithm
would simply wait 15 seconds.  This is the reason that I implemented
this change.

This is something that I was concerned about as well, but I could not
find another persistent way to do this.  I am open to suggestions of
which structures would be more acceptable.

Thanks,
Dave.
