Ok, I have compiled fsck from git, it calls itself 1.43-WIP (18-May-2014).

If I run it on my /dev/sda3, it still calls it clean and quits (even
through it should still have the "filesystem had error in past" flag).

I ran it -f, and it said all clean. Did not mention modifying the
filesystem.

Now I'm running fsck.new -cf. I don't think this filesystem has any
bad blocks. Still, it says "rootfs: Updating bad block inode."
... "FILE SYSTEM WAS MODIFIED", "REBOOT LINUX".

While looking at e2fsck sources:

                sprintf(buf, "badblocks -b %d -X %s%s%s %llu",
                fs->blocksize,
                        (ctx->options & E2F_OPT_PREEN) ? "" : "-s ",
                        (ctx->options & E2F_OPT_WRITECHECK) ? "-n " :
                "",
		                fs->device_name,
                ext2fs_blocks_count(fs->super)-1);
                f = popen(buf, "r");

...is it really good idea? I think it will do the bad thing in (crazy)
setup such as this, or in any setup with space in filename:

root@duo:/dev# ls -al  | grep echo
brw-rw----   1 root disk      8,   3 Jul  6 14:56 `echo ownered`
root@duo:/dev# /usr/local/bin/
e2fsck.new  unrar2      
root@duo:/dev# /usr/local/bin/e2fsck.new '`echo ownered`' 
e2fsck 1.43-WIP (18-May-2014)
`echo ownered` is mounted.
e2fsck: Cannot continue, aborting.

Best regards,
