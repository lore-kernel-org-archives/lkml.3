Thank you David this is helpful feedback.

What would a cover letter be like? Would that be a separate email to
the list, or maybe the first email in a patch series?

Sorry I've twice looked for the integration repo. I found some that
look like it could be but those had older commits. Could you direct me
to the exact branch I'd love to work against it. These patches were
done against linux-next.

I think small one function patches might be best. I have the codebase
mapped out and each file's functions-to-be-cleaned count varies
wildly. If I did batch files together and split large files apart
there would be no rhyme or reason for the groupings. With single
function patches it is very clear what changes are justified since
they should only occur in the affected function or in a call-site.
With multiple functions the call-site changes get mixed up would it
would be harder to review.

Daniel
