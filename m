  Yes, this is a known problem. The trouble is there isn't a reliable fix
currently possible. If we don't truncate page cache before removing blocks,
we will have pages in memory being backed by already freed blocks - not
good as that can lead to data corruption. So you should't really remove the
truncation from before we remove the blocks.

You are right that if punch hole races with page fault or read, we can
create again pages with block mapping which will become stale soon and the
same problem as I wrote above applies. Truncating pagecache after we
removed blocks only narrows the race window but doesn't really fix the
problem.

Properly fixing the problem requires significant overhaul in how mmap_sem
is used in page fault. I'm working on patches to do that but it will take
some time.
