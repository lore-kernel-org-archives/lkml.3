This is getting tiresome.  This patch (2/9) has my NAK.  The other
patches depend on it, so I will not ack them.  (The maintainers may or
may not care about my NAK -- that's their business.)

Your code is *wrong* for even the simple case of /proc/*/syscall.  Consider:

Start with two processes, a and b, both normal tasks started by an
unprivileged user.  Process a opens /proc/<b's pid>/syscall.  All
checks pass.  Process b execs a setcap'd binary.  So b's uid and gid
do not change.

Then process a redirects stdin to that existing /proc/<b's pid>/stack
fd.  Here's the bug in your patch: process a can *still* read that fd.
 Why?  Because *you're not checking that a's capabilities are a
superset of b's*.  That code lives in the LSM infrastructure.  You
need to call it if you want to keep the general approach you're
trying.  You can't fix this just by checking for CAP_PTRACE, because
then you'll break SELinux.

This is messy, and it's why I think that you'd be better off doing
this by revoking the fd on exec instead.
