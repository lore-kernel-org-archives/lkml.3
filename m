What is the relative performance of your benchmark with SELinux disabled?
While the oprofile graphs will be of passing interest to see that the
mbcache overhead is gone, they will not show the reduction in disk IO
from not writing/updating the external xattr blocks at all.

I agree that SELinux is enabled on enterprise distributions by default,
but I'm also interested to know how much overhead this imposes.  I would
expect that writing large external xattrs for each file would have quite
a significant performance overhead that should not be ignored.  Reducing
the mbcache overhead is good, but eliminating it entirely is better.

Depending on how much overhead SELinux has, it might be important to
spend more time to optimize it (not just the mbcache part), or users
may consider disabling SELinux entirely on systems where they care
about peak performance.

You have already done one of the tests that I'm interested in (the above
test which showed that disabling SELinux removed the mbcache overhead).
What I'm interested in is the actual performance (or relative performance
if you are not allowed to publish the actual numbers) of your AIM7
benchmark between SELinux enabled and SELinux disabled.

Next would be a new test that has SELinux enabled, but formatting the
filesystem with 512-byte inodes instead of the ext4 default of 256-byte
inodes.  If this makes a significant improvement, it would potentially
mean users and the upstream distros should use different formatting
options along with SELinux.  This is less clearly a win, since I don't
know enough details of how SELinux uses xattrs (I always disable it,
so I don't have any systems to check).

Cheers, Andreas
