I don't fully agree at this point. A lot of things can be tuned away,
but in practice we want things to perform well out of the box without
needing all kinds of magic tuning that only 

Also this is just normal file access, nothing special about it.
It simply has to scale. For all kinds of workloads.

And it does, just d_path messes it up.

This is about repeated access to arbitrary files.
