+.TH CAP_RIGHTS_LIMIT 2 2014-05-07 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
+.SH NAME
+cap_rights_limit \- limit Capsicum capability rights
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.nf
+.B #include <sys/capsicum.h>
+.sp
+.BI "int cap_rights_limit(int " fd ", const struct cap_rights *" rights ,
+.BI "                     unsigned int " fcntls ,
+.BI "                     int " nioctls ", unsigned int *" ioctls );
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+When a file descriptor is created by a function such as
+.BR accept (2),
+.BR accept4 (2),
+.BR creat (2),
+.BR epoll_create (2),
+.BR eventfd (2),
+.BR mq_open (2),
+.BR open (2),
+.BR openat (2),
+.BR pdfork (2),
+.BR pipe (2),
+.BR pipe2 (2),
+.BR signalfd (2),
+.BR socket (2),
+.BR socketpair (2)
+or
+.BR timerfd_create (2),
+it implicitly has all Capsicum capability rights.
+Those rights can be reduced (but never expanded) by using the
+.BR cap_rights_limit ()
+system call.
+Once Capsicum capability rights are reduced, operations on the file descriptor
+.I fd
+will be limited to those permitted by the remainder of the arguments.
+.PP
+The
+.I rights
+argument describes the primary rights for the file descriptor, and
+should be prepared using
+.BR cap_rights_init (3)
+family of functions.  The complete list of primary rights can be found in the
+.BR rights (7)
+manual page.
+.PP
+If a file descriptor is granted the
+.B CAP_FCNTL
+primary capability right, the list of allowed
+.BR fcntl (2)
+commands can be selectively reduced (but never expanded) with the
+.I fcntls
+argument.  The following flags may be specified in the
+.I fcntls
+argument:
+.TP
+.B CAP_FCNTL_GETFL
+Permit
+.B F_GETFL
+command.
+.TP
+.B CAP_FCNTL_SETFL
+Permit
+.B F_SETFL
+command.
+.TP
+.B CAP_FCNTL_GETOWN
+Permit
+.B F_GETOWN
+command.
+.TP
+.B CAP_FCNTL_SETOWN
+Permit
+.B F_SETOWN
+command.
+.PP
+A value of
+.B CAP_FCNTL_ALL
+for the
+.I fcntls
+argument leaves the set of allowed
+.BR fcntl (2)
+commands unchanged.
+.PP
+If a file descriptor is granted the
+.B CAP_IOCTL
+capability right, the list of allowed
+.BR ioctl (2)
+commands can be selectively reduced (but never expanded) using the
+.I nioctls
+and
+.I ioctls
+arguments.
+The
+.I ioctls
+argument is an array of
+.BR ioctl (2)
+command values and the
+.I nioctls
+argument specifies the number of elements in the array.
+.PP
+If the
+.I nioctls
+argument is -1 or 0, the
+.I ioctls
+argument is ignored, and either all
+.BR ioctl (2)
+operations or no
+.BR ioctl (2)
+operations (respectively) will be allowed.
+.PP
+Capsicum capability rights assigned to a file descriptor can be obtained with the
+.BR cap_rights_get (2)
+system call.
+.SH RETURN VALUE
+.BR cap_rights_limit ()
+returns zero on success. On error, -1 is returned and
+.I errno
+is set appropriately.
+.SH ERRORS
+.TP
+.B EBADF
+.I fd
+isn't a valid open file descriptor.
+.TP
+.B EINVAL
+An invalid set of rights has been requested in
+.IR rights .
+.TP
+.B ENOMEM
+Out of memory.
+.TP
+.B ENOTCAPABLE
+The arguments contain capability rights not present for the given file descriptor (Capsicum
+capability rights list can only be reduced, never expanded).
+.SH VERSION
+Capsicum support was added to the kernel in version 3.???.
