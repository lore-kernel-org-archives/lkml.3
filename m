Yes, I know that.  But all done does is queue the completion to the
softirq.  All you get with this is a reordering of that queue.  If you
can actually measure the performance impact of that, I'd be very
surprised.  We're talking under a microsecond in a round trip activity
that takes tens to hundreds of miliseconds to issue and complete.

It fixes something that isn't a problem.  The softirq won't even be
activated until all pending interrupts are serviced, so a command
arriving in the middle of processing gets immediately serviced on the
next interrupt before the softirq activates.
