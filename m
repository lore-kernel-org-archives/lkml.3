Straight answer is "no, there is no way to do so": UMH threads are spawned in "init" context.
But we solve the problem in a slightly different way.

So, here are my ideas about all the trackers (I haven't shared them yet, so I do it now):

1) nfsdcld uses SUNRPC pipefs, which is containerised already. So it was very easy to containerise it.

2) Legacy tracker uses path. All is great and simple until we imagine two containers with the same root. In this case we have to make sure, that we can start 
only one NFSd with this path (I don't care about user-space problems).
I was thinking about global in-kernel RB tree for all paths. But maybe even a simple global list is enough (not so many NFSd can be started, and it not a 
fast-path to optimise the search over all used paths).

3) UMH lookup and execute binary from current root. This problem just chasing all the containerisation work. So, either UHM logic have to updated (which is not 
trivial or easy to implement and push upstream), or process root have to swapped to the right (container's) one. This, BTW, not that hard, because UMH call 
accept "init" callback, which can be used to swap the root right before do_execve() is called.

What do you, guys, think about all this?
