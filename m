Ah, you're right, set_request doesn't happen if a bio is merged into
an existing request.

Ah, okay, so it's about missing the chance to look for cooperating
queues when merge succeeds.  Yeah, that makes a lot more sense to me.
If that's the case, wouldn't it be better to try finding cooperating
queues after each merge success rather than each allow_merge()
invocation?  And let's please document what we're catching with the
extra attempts.

Thanks.
