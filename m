Oh, hum - ok, so that would have been the better thing to check (or at
least an additional thing).

# find / -xdev -exec filefrag -x {} \; | awk -F : '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq -c

Finds quite a lot that claim to have external blocks, but it seems broken:

# filefrag -xv /var/lib/yum/repos/x86_64/6Server/epel
Filesystem type is: ef53
File size of /var/lib/yum/repos/x86_64/6Server/epel is 4096 (1 block, blocksize 4096)
 ext logical physical expected length flags
   0       0 32212996252             100 not_aligned,inline
/var/lib/yum/repos/x86_64/6Server/epel: 1 extent found

So _filefrag_ says it has a block (at a 120T physical address not on my fs!)

And yet it's a small attr:

# getfattr -m - -d /var/lib/yum/repos/x86_64/6Server/epel
getfattr: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names
# file: var/lib/yum/repos/x86_64/6Server/epel
security.selinux="unconfined_u:object_r:rpm_var_lib_t:s0"

And debugfs thinks it's stored within the inode:

debugfs:  stat var/lib/yum/repos/x86_64/6Server/epel

sooo seems like filefrag -x is buggy and can't be trusted.  :(

It's a userspace policy so the kernel shouldn't matter... "bloat" would
only come from new, longer contexts (outside the kernel).

selinux, from an fs allocation behavior perspective, is simply setxattr.

And as I showed earlier, name+value for all of the attrs set by at least RHEL6
selinux policy are well under 100 bytes.

(Add in a bunch of other non-selinux xattrs, and you'll go out of a 256b inode,
sure, but selinux on its own should not).
