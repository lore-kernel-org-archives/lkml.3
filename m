This is ancient, even by CentOS or RHEL standards. There are thousands 
of patches in more recent kernels (either at kernel.org or in the 
updates in CentOS repositories).

Nobody on linux-kernel or the other lists you copied is going to want to 
investigate problems on such an old kernel - you'll need to either 
reproduce with something current or seek assistance from the CentOS 
community (who will probably tell you to update your kernel first anyway).
