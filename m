That's true, but this is a change from previous behavior.  Previously,
x86 applied addr.translation_offset to both MEM and IO resources (in
setup_resource()), but ia64 applied it only to MEM resources (in
add_window()).  With your patch, we apply it to both types in
acpi_dev_resource_address_space(), which is a change for ia64.

I know translation_offset is used on some HP ia64 boxes, but I'm not
aware of it being used for IO resources on any x86 boxes.  On those
ia64 boxes, the bridge also does type translation (the resource is MEM
on the primary side but IO on the secondary side).  In that case, I'm
not sure it makes sense to add the translation_offset to an IO address
and expect the result to be a MEM address.

On these HP ia64 boxes, the firmware puts the CPU physical address of
the MEM resource in the translation_offset (see the call to
new_space()).  The bridge then translates that MEM resource to IO on
the secondary side.  It's awfully hard for me to extract this usage
from the ACPI spec, so possibly this is just a quirk of the way HP
encoded these IO resources.  But it *is* a precedent, and I'm not
aware of anybody doing anything that conflicts with it.

I wonder if it would make sense to make
acpi_dev_resource_address_space() ignore addr.translation_offset for
IO resources.  Or maybe ignore it if the _TTP (type translation) bit
is set?

I think the main intent of translation_offset (_TRA) is to map a
smaller address space into part of a larger space of the same type,
e.g., a 32-bit PCI memory space into a 40+ bit CPU memory space.  That
doesn't apply directly to IO ports, because I don't think any CPU has
a native IO port address space larger than 16 bits, so there's no
extra space to map into.

Mike, is there any chance you could collect an acpidump from an rx7620
or similar ia64 system?  In particular, I want to see a multi-node
system where we have several PCI domains, and whether it sets the _TTP
bits.

Yep, got it.  I wrote all that code originally :)  Obviously it hasn't
turned out to be particularly easy to understand.
