   That's a guess. I can tell it's a guess, because I've actually read
(some of) the rest of that function, so I've got a good idea of what I
think it will do -- and panic or oops is not the answer. Try again.
You can answer this question two ways: by test (see my suggestion
above), or by reading and understanding the code. Either will work in
this case, but doing neither is not an option for someone who wants to
change the function.

   So why didn't you? It's your patch, testing it is your job --
*before* it gets out into the outside world.
