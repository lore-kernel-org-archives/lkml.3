Very good point; I did have a more memory based mindset.

So this suggests that we will never be able to deal with a userspace
app accessing device registers in a unknowledgable, random, fashion -
the exact situation we are currently in today.  We could get to the
point of supporting UIO drivers, which would be more like device
drivers and have intimate detailed knowledge of what they are driving
and which would also introduce some of the mutual-exclusive ownership
issues we have talked about, but not unknowing userspace apps.

As such, your first suggestion below to enforce the mutual-exclusion
aspects that are necessary is still not enough to solve the current
issue being encountered.  An idle device would allow 'udevadm' to
acquire ownership and the sysfs based access to BAR1 would end in
catastrophe due to the device's strict access restrictions to this
BARs I/O Port region.  I also agree that the whitelist/blacklist
tactic seems like a complete slippery slope.  So where does that leave
us in trying to solve this issue?


Xianglinag: could you elaborate on the exact way the device is failing
due to the DWord I/O Port read of BAR1 and how that leads to the
platform hanging as this is still not understood and a lot of people
are confused by this?  We understand why this access is invalid for
this device (i.e. the BE [Byte Enable] discussion) but we don't
understand how such an access attempt ends up so catastrophic, causing
the platform to hang.
