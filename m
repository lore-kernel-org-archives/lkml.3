I'm not totally convinced by this, but then I haven't played with the code
so maybe I'm wrong.
I don't see the above as "sorting" faila and failb, but rather determining
which one is first.  Once you know which one is first, the remainder follow
in order.
So I would probably just make sure we always process the block is the "righ=
t"
order.  Then sorting would be irrelevant.
But as I say, I haven't fiddled with the code, so maybe that would end up
being more complex.

Thanks,
NeilBrown
