OK, it felt strange at first but now that I am thinking about it some
more it starts making sense. So the semantic is: Either zero page
(disconnected from the backing store) or the original content after
madvise(MADV_FREE). The page gets connected to the backing store after
it gets modified again. If this is the case then the sentence in the man
page makes perfect sense.

What made me confused was that I expected file backed pages would get a
fresh page from the origin but this would be awkward I guess.

Dunno, I guess the original content was slightly better. Or the
following wording from UNIX man pages is even more descriptive
(http://www.lehman.cuny.edu/cgi-bin/man-cgi?madvise+3)
"
Tell the kernel that contents in the specified address range are no
longer important and the range will be overwritten. When there is
demand for memory, the system will free pages associated with the
specified address range. In this instance, the next time a page in the
address range is referenced, it will contain all zeroes.  Otherwise,
it will con- tain the data that was there prior to the MADV_FREE
call. References made to the address range will not make the system read
from backing store (swap space) until the page is modified again.

This value cannot be used on mappings that have underlying file objects.
"

I would just clarify the last sentence with addition
(MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS mappings in this implementation). The
difference to MADV_DONTNEED is more complicated now so I wouldn't make
the text even more confusing.

Anyway the confusion started on my end so feel free to stick with the
BSD wording (modulo malloc note which is really confusing as the default
glibc allocator doesn't do that AFAIK).
