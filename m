I think you missed the first svc_close_list?:

The idea is that before we'd like to close all the listeners first, so
that they aren't busy creating more tempsocks while we're trying to
close them.

I overlooked a race, though: if another thread was already handling an
accept for one of the listeners then it might not get closed by that
first svc_clean_up_xprts.

I guess we could do something like:

	delay = 0;

    again:
	numclosed = svc_close_list(serv, &serv->sv_permsocks, net);
	numclosed += svc_close_list(serv, &serv->sv_tempsocks, net);
	if (numclosed) {
		svc_clean_up_xprts(serv, net);
		msleep(delay++);
		goto again;
	}

Seems a little cheesy, but if we don't care much about shutdown
performance in a rare corner case, maybe it's the simplest way out?
