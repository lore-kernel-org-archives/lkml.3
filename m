Thank for the comment, but my point is that it is the d_lock contention 
is skewing the data about how much spin lock contention had actually 
happened in the workload and it makes it harder to pinpoint problem 
areas to look at. This is not about performance, it is about accurate 
representation of performance data. Ideally, we want the overhead of 
turning on perf instrumentation to be as low as possible.

What made it contend so much was the large number of CPUs available in 
my test system which is a 8-socket Westmere EX machines with 80 cores. 
As perf was collecting data from every core, the threads will 
unavoidably bump into each other to translate dentries back to the full 
paths. The current code only allows one CPU in the d_path() critical 
path. My patch will allow all of them to be in the critical path 
concurrently.

The upcoming Ivy-Bridge EX can have up to 15 cores per socket. So even a 
4-socket machine will have up to 60 cores or 120 virtual CPUs if 
hyperthreading is turned on.

The first patch can also independently improve the performance of a 
number of AIM7 workloads including almost 7X improvement in the short 
workload. More detailed information of these types of performance 
benefit was discussed in the patch description of the first patch. I 
will try to collect more performance improvement data on other workloads 
too.

Thank for the review.
