Exactly: client first, then I realized you'd want to look at the server-side too.

..in order to rule out a mistake on my part with the two separate runs (which prevents correlated analysis) I was just about to boot the server back into 3.18.1 and re-run both client- and server-side traces simultaneously. However I have to head out for a bit first; will post that later today.

Thanks so far!
