What do you mean by "simple" here? Simple to implement?
We already have a preforked thread, called "UMH", used exactly for this purpose.
And, if I'm not mistaken, we are trying to discuss, how to adapt existent infrastructure for namespaces, don't we?

Regardless of the context itself, we need a way to pass it to kernel thread and to put kernel thread in this context. Or I'm missing something?

Yes, you are right. So, this solution can help only in case of very specific and simple "environment-less" programs.
So, I believe, that we should modify UMH itself to support our needs. But I don't see, how to make the idea more pleasant for the community.
IOW, when I was talking about UMH in NFS implementation on Ksummit, Linus's answer was something like "fix NFS".
And I can't object it, actually, because for now NFS is the only corner case.

Jeff said, that there are a bunch of UMH calls in kernel, but this is not solid enough to prove UHM changes, since nobody is trying to use them in containers.

So, I doubt, that we can change UMH generically without additional use-cases for 'containerized" UMH.
