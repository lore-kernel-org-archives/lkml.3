Just add one further detail here. What I'm thinking is, maybe instead there
should be something like:

struct flockx {
    int flags;
    /* Other fields like 'struct flock' */
    char reserved[32];	/* Or some suitable value */
}

That flags field might always be zero for now, but in the future it 
could be used on the setlk and getlk operations to indicate the presence
of additional fields in the structure.

Cheers,

Michael
