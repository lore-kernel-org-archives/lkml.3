We tried to discuss and understand the problem, yet all we got was
"it's OBVIOUS" and "Google has been using this patch ever since we
switched to memcg" and flat out repetitions of the same points about
reliable OOM notification that were already put into question.

You still have not convinced me that the problem exists as you
described it, apart from the aspects that Michal is now fixing
separately because you did not show any signs of cooperating.

None of this will change until you start working with us and actually
address feedback and inquiries instead of just repeating your talking
points over and over.
