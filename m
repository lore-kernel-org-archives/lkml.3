If we fix it at source, why would there be any need to filter?  That's
the reason the no_write_same flag was introduced.  If we can find and
fix the bug, it can go back into the stable trees as a bug fix, hence
nothing should ever emit write_same(10 or 16) and additional driver code
is redundant (and counter productive, since if this ever breaks again
you're our best canary).

This looks like it might be the problem but Martin should confirm (I
think the problem comes to us from the RC16 code which unconditionally
sets WS16).
