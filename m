The logic you've described is more or less the same thing that I
described with a process transition in.  It's:

connect to bus
send kdbus fd to another process, which does the rest:
request bus metadata
if (bus metadata matches expectations) {
  great, trust the bus!
} else {
  oh crap! (or malfunction or whatever)
}

ISTM you should have an API to get the *name* of the bus and check that.

Except that, if the service you pass that fd to is privileged, then
you're completely screwed, because none of this checks that the
*domain* is correct.

DNS names also have no effect on your ability to send to an IP.

In any event, I think you can keep doing everything that you're
currently doing if you check policy on the actual sent-to name.  Users
will just apply the *same* policy to all of their names (or just use
one name), and everything will work.  And, for bonus points, the
security rules will make sense.

But this set of patches doesn't "leave this in".  This set of patches
*adds it*.  Designing a poor new API is not excused by the fact that
no one has developed the better one yet.

Is the issue that, if I send a proxied request to unique name foo, and
unique name foo is help by someone who's claimed /a/b/c, then the
proxy service needs to check for permission to talk to /a/b/c?

To me, this still feels like this is only an issue because of this
weird concept of how names and policies interact.  I really think that
you should put some extra effort into making the policy matches
self-contained in the sense of only matching on addressing information
that's actually in the message.

For example, HELLO could indicate one of "anyone can talk to me" or
"no one can talk to me without using a well-known name", then the
problem is solved.  Protocols that switch to using the unique name
(e.g. glib) can send *both* the unique and well-known name and the
access control will still work.

I really don't think that this kind of mostly indiscriminate
broadcasting of almost-invariably unnecessary and potentially
dangerous information is justified by the limited logging and
debugging benefit.  I think you should find a better design that
solves your problem.

We're talking about users, not senders, and users aren't going to
expect that they're sending their command line arond the bus.  And
there could also receivers who are sandboxed and can't access /proc.

My point is that this information is probably okay to expose to
privileged logging daemons, and *maybe* to journald, but it's not okay
to pass anywhere else.

So this mechanism is there to speed up reboot and similar things?

It absolutely is better.  You can, in software, change the rules, and
euid works intelligently in namespaces.  Aside from being a bad idea,
caps are just *broken* without knowledge of the userns hierarchy *and*
userns ownership information.

ns_capable is the in-kernel interface, but the return value of
ns_capable can't be calculated from just the cap mask.

Also, have you ever tried to usefully assign caps to euid != 0 users?
It's essentially entirely broken, especially if you try to use execve.
Don't force the use of the crappy fscaps interface to allow non-root
to reboot cleanly without invoking policykit -- you won't be doing
anyone any favors.  Just set your userspace policy the way you want
it.

I've tried to fix this, I've written patches, I've designed
alternative and IMO far superior cap transition rules.  Guess what?
They're not in the kernel because no one wants to touch caps.  But
that doesn't mean that the existing cap system is anything other than
a giant pile of cr*p that happens to sort of work.  Don't make user
code have to deal with the mess more than it already has to.

I find it highly implausible that kdbus logging users really benefit
from knowing the *caps* of other participants in any context in which
their euid isn't enough.

Or you could remove it in the absence of a real legitimate use case.

Then find a clean way that's gated on having the right /proc access,
which is not guaranteed to exist on all of your eventual users'
systems, and, if that access doesn't exist because the admin or
sandbox designer has sensibly revoked it, then kdbus shouldn't
override them.
