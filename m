You seem to be missing something here...

There are *two* mappings in 64-bit mode.  Physically, if you're going to
randomize you might as well randomize over the entire range... except
not too far down (on either 32 or 64 bit mode)... in particular, you
don't want to drop below 16 MiB if you can avoid it.

On 64 bits, there is no reason the virtual address has to be randomized
the same way.
