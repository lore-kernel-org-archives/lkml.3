phys_base is not changed during relocation. For example, if I print
out phys_base during this pr_emerg call, it remains 0x0, even though
the random offset was 0xa200000.

Correct, we are not currently using kdump.

It seems like all the information you need would still be available?
The virtual address is there, so it should be trivial to see the
offset, IIUC.

Sure, though not phys_base, but rather the offset? I think this is
similar to coredumps of PIE binaries end up with, though I haven't
looked very closely at that in a while.
