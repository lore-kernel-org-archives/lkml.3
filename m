I was thinking about "lightweight mapping" which is simple shifting. Since
we're trying to make this co-work with user-ns mappings, simple uid/gid shift
should be enough. Please, correct me if I'm wrong.

If I'm not, then it looks to be enough to have two per-sb or per-mnt values
for uid and gid shift. Per-mnt for now looks more promising, since container's
FS may be just a bind-mount from shared disk.

User-space crossing? From my point of view it would be enough if we just turn
uid/gid read from disk (well, from whenever FS gets them) into uids, that would
match the user-ns's ones, this sould cover the VFS layer and related syscalls
only, which is, IIRC stat-s family and chown.

Ouch, and the whole quota engine :\

Thanks,
