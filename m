Actually, looking at this now, it looks like this is just an open-coded
kernel_write. I think this could be made a bit cleaner by using that instead;
the tradeoff is that each call to kernel_write will do the address space
flip-flop, so if the write gets split up into many calls, there'd be some
slight overhead. That's probably a microoptimization, but I think it's worth
looking into making kernel_read and kernel_write handle the retry logic.

It looks like Oren Laadan submitted a patch doing exactly that as part of the
checkpoint/restart patch series: https://lkml.org/lkml/2010/5/6/142. I've added
an email address that I found for him.

Did anyone ever come up with a good answer for this?
