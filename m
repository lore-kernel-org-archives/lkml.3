Correct

Yes for 1) and that's what exactly this series try to do
 * ptrace checks during ->open() for /proc/*/{stack,syscall} and 0400
 * You can't do it for /proc/*/stat otherwise you will break userspace
  "ps"..., ps must access /proc/1/stat etc... so the proposed solution
  will work without any side effect.
  
  And for /proc/*/maps you will perhaps break glibc under certain
  situations... so just hold it for the moment and test it
  later. There have been reports in the past about it.

  So for 1) this series will fix it 

For type 2) yes this series will also handle it, since there were a cred
change.


For fd revoking, yes that perhaps will work and it would be great, but
it does not exist :-/

Not to mention if the process do not want to revoke and pass the fd ?
is this compliant with standards ?

No that's not correct.

read(2) and during each system call current->cred must be checked,
the /proc varies at runtime, you are not sure about what are you
reading,writing...
