Implied mb of test_and_set_bit() in queue_work_on() ensures that the
newly assigned work function is visible on all cpus before evaluating
whether or not the work can be queued.

Ok.

I think this needs an smp_rmb() here.

Otherwise this cpu could speculatively load workfn before
set_work_pool_and_clear_pending(), which means that the old workfn
could have been loaded but PENDING was still set and caused queue_work_on()
to reject the work as already pending.

Result: the new work function never runs.

But this exposes a more general problem that I believe workqueue should
prevent; speculated loads and stores in the work item function should be
prevented from occurring before clearing PENDING in
set_work_pool_and_clear_pending().

IOW, the beginning of the work function should act like a barrier in
the same way that queue_work_on() (et. al.) already does.
