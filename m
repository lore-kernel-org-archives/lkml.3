Because it's a property of the process' userns, not a property of the process.

userns_setgroups would be okay.  (Arguably it should've been
userns_uid_map, too, but at least uid_map sounds obviously
namespace-related.)

current_clocksource?  I think there are lots of things like that.

I can imagine a mode where there's a fixed set of groups that are
forced set but other groups can be added and dropped.  It would be
complicated to set up right, but someone might want it some day.

You can use your fsgid to make a setgid file, I think.  But yes, point
taken, although as mentioned in the other thread, I think it would be
a lot clearer if it were a separate patch.

I agree that the cap model is screwy.  But we use CAP_SYS_ADMIN for
everything else that changes the overall behavior of a namespace.

In any event, the only way it matters is for a non-ns owner in the
parent ns with CAP_SETGID set but not CAP_SYS_ADMIN.  I'd argue that
CAP_SETGID should not be usable to make unrelated process' syscalls
fail.

Then you really want CAP_SYS_ADMIN, I think.

Yeah.

For long-term use, I kind of like the flags approach I added in the
other patch.  It makes it easy to add more flags in the future.

In any event, I think the only barrier that's needed is when writing gid_map:

atomic_read / test_bit to determine whether unpriv mappings are okay;
smp_mb() or whatever the current _after_atomic thing is these days;
write mapping;

Although I'm not sure whether Linux supports any architectures that
can violate causality in the way that barrier is there to prevent.
