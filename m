I looked through the call chain; it seems to be intentional behaviour on
the part of block.  Just from an mq point of view, it would make better
code if we unconditionally initialised rq->timeout early and allowed
prep to modify it and then dumped the if(!req->timeout) in
blk_add_timer(), but it's a marginal if condition that would compile to
a conditional store on sensible architectures, so losing the conditional
probably isn't worth worrying about.

Cc'd Jens for his opinion with the block patch
