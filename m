For the "add a struct file * to struct seq_file" and set it during
seq_open(), It was proposed by Linus, but Al Viro didn't like it:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/9/25/765

I'm not sure if this will work for you: you can make seq_file->private
cache some data, by calling single_open()... at ->open(), later check it
during read()...


As noted by Eric, I'll also go for the capability check at ->open(), if it
does not break some userspace. BTW the CAP_SYSLOG check should do the job

Checks during read() are not sufficient, since the design allows passing
file descriptors and dup() stdin/stdout of suid-execve.


IMO: unprivileged code should not get that file descriptor, so ->open()
should fail.
If this will break userspace then allow open() and cache result for read()


Can you emulate the behaviour of kptr_restrict=1 ? If so:
1) perform check during open() and cache data
2) during read() check kptr_restrict==1
   check the cached value and if opener had CAP_SYSLOG  if so:
   print something like this: 00000000 T startup_32

All this without modifying vsprintf, I mean just do the checks outside
vsprintf() inside your ->read()

Just my 2 cents
