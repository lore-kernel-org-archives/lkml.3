Or git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/fs/xfs/xfstests-dev.git, which is
where I typically update first and push dev branches to.

See the code in the src/renameat2.c for an example of how syscalls
and their flags are added prior to their being kernel and userspace
header support.

Also, note the "-t" CLI option for the "test" option in that little
program.  This is used by the _require_renameat2 function that the
tests that make use of this functionality call to determine if th
etest shoul dbe run on this kernel or not.

I wish. I've tried to get it archived on all the major sites like
marc, spinics, etc repeatedly since the list was created and not a
single one of them have responded to any of my requests, let alone
started to archive the list....

Cheers,

Dave.
