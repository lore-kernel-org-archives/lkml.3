Good catch!  (This should also answer Peter Hurley's concern on another
email thread.)

The last "stores" on the third line should be a "loads":

	Memory operations issued before the ACQUIRE may be
	completed after the ACQUIRE operation has completed.  An
	smp_mb__before_spinlock(), combined with a following ACQUIRE,
	orders prior loads against subsequent loads and stores and
	also orders prior stores against subsequent stores.  Note that
	this is weaker than smp_mb()!  The smp_mb__before_spinlock()
	primitive is free on many architectures.

Good point.  How about the following?

	When the ACQUIRE and RELEASE are a lock acquisition and release,
	respectively, this same reordering can of course occur if the
	lock's ACQUIRE and RELEASE are to the same lock variable, but
	only from the perspective of another CPU not holding that lock.

One key point is that we are only talking about the CPU doing the
interchanging, not the compiler.  If the compiler (or, for that matter,
the developer) switched the operations, deadlock -could- occur.

But suppose the CPU interchanged the operations.  In this case, the
unlock precede the lock in the assembly code.  The CPU simply elected
to try executing the lock operation first.  If there is a deadlock,
this lock operation will simply spin (or try to sleep, but more on
that later).  The CPU will eventually execute the unlock operation
(which again preceded the lock operation in the assembly code), which
will unravel the potential deadlock.

But what if the lock is for a sleeplock?  In that case, the code will
try to enter the scheduler, where it will eventually encounter a
memory barrier, which will force the unlock operation to complete,
again unraveling the deadlock.

Please see below for a patch against the current version of
Documentation/memory-barriers.txt.  Does this update help?

    This commit fixes a couple of typos and clarifies what happens when
    the CPU chooses to execute a later lock acquisition before a prior
    lock release, in particular, why deadlock is avoided.

 If it is necessary for a RELEASE-ACQUIRE pair to produce a full barrier, the
