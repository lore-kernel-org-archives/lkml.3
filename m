  You see big degradation only in SAN environments because they have
generally higher latency to complete a single request. And given appending
direct IO is completely synchronous, the latency is the only thing that
really matters for performance. I've also seen my desktop-grade SATA drive
perform better than some enterprise grade SAN for this particular
workload...

  Yes, that's expected. The latency to complete a request consists of some
fixed overhead + time to write data. So for small request sizes the latency
is constant (corresponding to bandwidth growing linearly with the request
size) and for larger request sizes latency somewhat grows so bandwidth grows
slower and slower (as the time to write the data forms larger and larger
part of the total latency)...
