Changelog for sg3_utils-1.35 [20130117] [svn: r476]
   - sg_compare_and_write: new utility
...

So it has been released for 6 months. Also version 1.36
has been released since then so you might check more
often. Does Eric's version have any improvements over the
version already in sg3_utils? [Apart from a shorter name ...]
