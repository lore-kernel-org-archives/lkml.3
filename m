The xfstests for those features were merged into xfstests at the
same time the the kernel code was pulled into the XFS tree. i.e.
once the kernel code had been merged into a maintainer's tree. That's
why they were there for the testing you needed to do with ext4.

There hasn't been any XFS patches written for renameat2 and the
patches that were posted as "here's some tests, maybe we'll get
renameat2 into 3.15" so there hasn't been any urgency indicated to
the xfstests folks that they were needed. We've been pretty much out
of the loop here....

Actually, we don't add tests to xfstests until the patches that they
test are committed to an upstream repository somewhere. i.e. we need
some guarantee that the code is actually accepted by a maintainer
and is on it's way to mainline before we'll include the tests. We
don't want to have to waste time on reviewing and committing tests
for functionality that never goes into the mainline tree....

I asked whether this patchset is going to make 3.15 and reviewed the
xfstests patches that had been posted earlier today. About 12 hours
before I read this thread.... ;)

Cheers,

Dave.
