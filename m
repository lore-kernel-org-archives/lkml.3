This is a bit confusing. What about "otherwise the css refcount will be
released after the last kmem allocation is uncharged."

I do not feel strongly about that but maybe open coding this in
mem_cgroup_css_offline would be even better. There is only single caller
and there is smaller chance somebody will use the function incorrectly
later on.

So I leave the decision on you because this doesn't matter much.
