Subject: [PATCH 0/6 v14] gpio: Add block GPIO
Date: Tue, 22 Jan 2013 13:06:38 +0100
Message-Id: <1358856404-8975-1-git-send-email-stigge@antcom.de>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 1.7.10.4
X-FEAS-SYSTEM-WL: rst@work-microwave.de, 192.168.11.78
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This set of patches adds:

* Block GPIO API to gpiolib
* Sysfs support for GPIO API, to provide userland access
* Device interface for userland access (alternative to sysfs)
* Devicetree support to instantiate GPIO blocks via DT
* Example implementations in several gpio drivers since they need
  special accessor functions for block wise GPIO access (only for some
  selected drivers since the feature is optional and not suitable for
  all GPIO hardware)
* Fix for race condition in gpiolib on device creation

Testing branch available at: git://git.antcom.de/linux-2.6.git blockgpio

Applies to v3.8-rc4

Changes since v13:
* Adjusted __raw_readl to readl_relaxed, __raw_writel to writel_relaxed
  (forward porting of pinctrl-at91.c)
* Adjusted to mainline change: Removed __devinit and __devinitdata

Changes since v12:
* Added support for gpio drivers ge, ks8695, mc33880, ml-ioh, mpc5200 and
  mpc8xxx
* Added support for pinctrl driver at91

Changes since v11:
* Removed support for at91, since this one is currently in the migration
  process to pinctrl implementation
* Fixed mask setting via sysfs
* Device interface: declare gpio_block_fop_poll() static

Changes since v10:
* gpioblock-of.c: Catch <1 specified GPIOs
* gpioblock-of.c: Fixed memory leak in probe()'s error path
* gpioblock-of.c: Fixed block node's refcount via of_node_put()
* Added driver support for samsung, mm-lantiq and sa1100
* Added driver support for at91 (by Wolfgang Grandegger)
* Added pinctrl driver support for pinctl-nomadik

Changed since v9:
* Changed IRQ flags for device interface's poll() from IRQF_TRIGGER_FALLING
  to IRQF_SHARED
* Use block name on gpio_request
* Added spinlock for ISR manipulated data (dev interface / poll())

Changed since v8:
* Added poll() function to dev interface for IRQ handling
* Fixed gpio_block_register() in case of missing CONFIG_GPIO_SYSFS
* Fixed mask handling in sysfs interface
* Fixed get_user/put_user pointer (cast)

Changes since v7:
* Fixed error in API documentation (name arg missing in prototype)
* Fixed compile error if sysfs is missing: Moved gpio_block_is_output()
  out of sysfs-ifdef
* Added error handling to gpio_block_register()
* Added mask attribute to sysfs (although dev interface exists now)

Changes since v6:
* Changed realloc to list handling
* Added mask to kernel API
* Added device interface as userspace API
* Changed sizeof() to BITS_PER_LONG
* Fixed multiline comment style
* Documented direction setting by the user
* Documented order of handled chips in case of multiple chips in one block

Changes since v5:
* Documented sysfs: elaborated on "exported" and "values" attributes
* Documented sysfs: gpiochip is a separate class now
* Aggregated driver support patches for block gpio into one single patch
* Added gpio block driver support for twl6040 and pch

Changes since v4:
* Documented word width
* Bugfix: export/unexport on register/unregister
* Using default dev_attrs for gpio_block_class
* Fix gpiolib: race condition on device creation
* Added driver support for ucb14500, vt8500, xilinx

Changes since v3:
* Added driver support for pca953x, em, pl061, max732x, pcf857x
* Coding style improvements
* Fixed krealloc memory leak in error case
* sysfs: values in hex
* Register blocks in a list
* Narrowing lock scope
* Use S_IWUSR and S_IRUGO instead of direct octal values
* Use for_each_set_bit()
* Change from unsigned to unsigned long for masks and values

Changes since v2:
* Added sysfs support
* Added devicetree support
* Added support for lpc32xx, generic
* Added functions for GPIO block registration
* Added more error checking
* Bit remapping bugfix

Changes since v1:
* API change to 32/64 bit word, bit masks
