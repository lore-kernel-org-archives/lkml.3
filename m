I had thought of indexed inode flags as an alternative to the xattr/string
parsing thing.  Feature flags make their first appearance as part of a per-FS
flag-space and are migrated to the common flag-space when there is demand.
It would also avoid the need for each fs to create its own flag ioctl.

On the other hand, someone suggested I try remaking IOC_[GS]ETFLAG as an xattr,
so off I went. :)

#define FS_IOC_FLAGS_COMMON	0
#define FS_IOC_FLAGS_COMMON2	1
#define FS_IOC_FLAGS_EXT4	0xEF53

struct inode_flag_ioctl {
	u32 flag;
	u32 value;	/* or u64? */
};
#define FS_IOC_GETFLAGS2 _IOR('f', 12, struct inode_flag_ioctl);
#define FS_IOC_SETFLAGS2 _IOW('f', 13, struct inode_flag_ioctl);

foo() {
	struct inode_flag_ioctl if;

	if.flag = FS_IOC_FLAGS_COMMON;
	ioctl(fd, FS_IOC_GETFLAGS2, &if);
	printf("%d\n", if.value);

	if.flag = FS_IOC_FLAGS_EXT4;
	if.value = EXT5_BONGHITS_FL | EXT4_EA_INODE_FL;
	ioctl(fd, FS_IOC_SETFLAGS2, &if);
}

I prefer strings too, but I suppose one pays for the complexity.  Given that
all the flags so far seem to have been booleans, this could be good enough.

Agreed.
