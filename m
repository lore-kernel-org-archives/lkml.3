That structure includes an NR_CPU-based maskbits field, which is
probably too big.

include/cpumask.h:
typedef struct cpumask { DECLARE_BITMAP(bits, NR_CPUS); } cpumask_t;

drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_sli4.h:
struct lpfc_vector_map_info {
        uint16_t        phys_id;
        uint16_t        core_id;
        uint16_t        irq;
        uint16_t        channel_id;
        struct cpumask  maskbits;
};

maskbits appears to only be used for setting IRQ affinity hints in
drivers/scsi/lpfc_init.c:
        for (idx = 0; idx < vectors; idx++) {
                cpup = phba->sli4_hba.cpu_map;
                cpu = lpfc_find_next_cpu(phba, phys_id);
                ...
                mask = &cpup->maskbits;
                cpumask_clear(mask);
                cpumask_set_cpu(cpu, mask);
                i = irq_set_affinity_hint(phba->sli4_hba.msix_entries[idx].
                                          vector, mask);

In similar code, mpt3sas and lockless hpsa just call get_cpu_mask()
inside the loop:
        cpu = cpumask_first(cpu_online_mask);
        for (i = 0; i < h->msix_vector; i++) {
                rc = irq_set_affinity_hint(h->intr[i], get_cpu_mask(cpu));
                cpu = cpumask_next(cpu, cpu_online_mask);
        }

get_cpu_mask() uses the global cpu_bit_bitmap array, which is declared
in kernel/cpu.c:
extern const unsigned long
        cpu_bit_bitmap[BITS_PER_LONG+1][BITS_TO_LONGS(NR_CPUS)];

That approach should work for lpfc.
