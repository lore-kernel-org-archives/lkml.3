Aren't read() time checks fundamentally unrobust? We generally don't do 
locking on read()s, so such checks - in the general case - are pretty 
racy.

Now procfs might be special, as by its nature of a pseudofilesystem it's 
far more atomic than other filesystems, but still IMHO it's a lot more 
robust security design wise to revoke access to objects you should not 
have a reference to when a security boundary is crossed, than letting 
stuff leak through and sprinking all the potential cases that may leak 
information with permission checks ...

It's also probably faster: security boundary crossings are relatively rare 
slowpaths, while read()s are much more common...

So please first get consensus on this fundamental design question before 
spreading your solution to more areas.

Thanks,

	Ingo
