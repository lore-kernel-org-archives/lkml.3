Then you need to get a better distro, as any "well run" long-term
enterprise distro handles stuff like this for you.  Otherwise you need
to update systems properly.  There's nothing that I can do here to help
with that, nor do I ever want to, sorry.

I fail to understand how any of this relates to CUSE, please provide
specifics.

You have full access to a debugger, what more do you need?  :)

And why would you need to debug the kernel kdbus code?  Is something not
working properly in it?  Otherwise just use wireshark to read the kdbus
data stream and all should be fine.

Kernel code is hard, security matters, yes I know this, we all have been
doing this for a very long time.  Of course bugs happen, but if you look
closely, your "attack surface" is now smaller using kdbus than it was
using old-style dbus.

How does the current implementation not work properly for this?  The
filesystem implementation makes this easier than ever, while sticking
with the character device made this quite difficult in different ways.

Not really, sorry, the specifics are quite different.

One specific implementation of the library code is in the systemd repo.
There is nothing keeping anyone from forking it and putting it somewhere
else if you depend on it.  Odds are, you aren't going to need to do that
as your old-style dbus applications will work just fine, no changes
needed.
