That was a thinko.  "...we'll be back to 2.6.39." is what I meant.

Yes, here's the result of dbench on ext2:

3.8.0-rc3:
 Operation      Count    AvgLat    MaxLat
 ----------------------------------------
 WriteX        109347     0.028    59.817
 ReadX         347180     0.004     3.391
 Flush          15514    29.828   287.283

Throughput 57.429 MB/sec  4 clients  4 procs  max_latency=287.290 ms

3.8.0-rc3 + patches:
 WriteX        105556     0.029     4.273
 ReadX         335004     0.005     4.112
 Flush          14982    30.540   298.634

Throughput 55.4496 MB/sec  4 clients  4 procs  max_latency=298.650 ms

As you can see, for ext2 the maximum write latency decreases from ~60ms on a
laptop hard disk to ~4ms.  I'm not sure why the flush latencies increase,
though I suspect that being able to dirty pages faster gives the flusher more
work to do.

Here's what you get on ext4:

3.8.0-rc3:
 WriteX         85624     0.152    33.078
 ReadX         272090     0.010    61.210
 Flush          12129    36.219   168.260

Throughput 44.8618 MB/sec  4 clients  4 procs  max_latency=168.276 ms

3.8.0-rc3 + patches:
 WriteX         86082     0.141    30.928
 ReadX         273358     0.010    36.124
 Flush          12214    34.800   165.689

Throughput 44.9941 MB/sec  4 clients  4 procs  max_latency=165.722 ms

Here the average write latency goes down, and all maximum latencies drop too.

Just for kicks, here's XFS:

3.8.0-rc3:
 WriteX        125739     0.028   104.343
 ReadX         399070     0.005     4.115
 Flush          17851    25.004   131.390

Throughput 66.0024 MB/sec  4 clients  4 procs  max_latency=131.406 ms

3.8.0-rc3 + patches:
 WriteX        123529     0.028     6.299
 ReadX         392434     0.005     4.287
 Flush          17549    25.120   188.687

Throughput 64.9113 MB/sec  4 clients  4 procs  max_latency=188.704 ms

Hey look, dramatically lower maximum latencies for writes, though flushes seem
slower.

...and btrfs, just to round it out:

3.8.0-rc3:
 WriteX         67122     0.083    82.355
 ReadX         212719     0.005     2.828
 Flush           9547    47.561   147.418

Throughput 35.3391 MB/sec  4 clients  4 procs  max_latency=147.433 ms

3.8.0-rc3 + patches:
 WriteX         64898     0.101    71.631
 ReadX         206673     0.005     7.123
 Flush           9190    47.963   219.034

Throughput 34.0795 MB/sec  4 clients  4 procs  max_latency=219.044 ms

Same kinds of results here, though the increase in max read latency is a little
troubling.

Ok.
