I’ve measured some long (>10usec) latencies for queue_workqueue()
and wake_up_bit() calls with CPU-intensive workloads.

Often these APIs are invoked while one or more spinlocks are
held. That makes it easy to back up a lot of work if one of
these calls is slow for any reason.

For wake_up_bit(), this doesn’t include how long it takes before
the awoken process is run. With CPU-intensive workloads, it’s
often the case that hundreds of usecs elapse, and the awoken
process is migrated to another CPU (observed via ftrace).
