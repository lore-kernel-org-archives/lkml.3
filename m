OK, the fix from the SCSI point of view is to make the mpt teardown path
actually work.  The whole thing looks to be a complete mess because
there's another place where it will do the wrong thing in
mptscsih_remove().  You always have to call mpt_detach() otherwise the
device doesn't get removed from the lists.  In theory this patch fixes
both bugs in the driver.
