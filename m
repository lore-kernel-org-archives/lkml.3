Only tinkerers would contribute to something like
the scsi_debug driver. After all, the pros could
rely on their T10 compliant vendor equipment :-)

And you are right, I do like to test sg_format
against something real. Perhaps sg_format is the
utility those server vendors use. Another
tinkerer called James Bottomley wrote the original
sg_format code, according to my notes.

Ah, the current SBC-3 draft (sbc3r36.pdf) does say if one
does a READ from a disk with logical provisioning enabled
and LBPRZ=0 then the block data is "vendor specific" and
the PI, if any, is all 0xff bytes. That last bit was added
in sbc3r34.pdf (and it was "any value" prior to that).

Back to the original question, I don't think Sagi was
asking if it was valid to do a legacy/unprotected READ,
it was what to expect with a protected READ on
unwritten blocks:

So the precise answer is: the PI will be all 0xff bytes,
unless logical provisioning is enabled, LBPRZ=0 and the
device's compliance predates sbc3r34.pdf (November 2012).
