OK - I'll change this.

I'll have to think about this.  I'm not sure what the
correct phrasing would be for XIP systems (for which part of
the kernel resides in flash, not RAM, maybe "memory"?)

I can print it as part of total output, but for regression
testing and automation I want the tool to have a single
number result as output (well, one number relating to runtime
size, and I'm considering adding one number relating
to compile-time size.)

This is part of the TAP output format.

Is there any (other) output format being standardized for selftest
programs?

TAP allows me to output more human-readable information to go
along with the "official" result, but I'd like to keep the
official result in TAP format so it can be handled by automated
tools.  Maybe it would be best to output both.

I'll try to make a counter-proposal tomorrow that we can discus.

No problem.  Thanks for looking at it.
I have some additional changes, based on feedback from Josh Triplett,
so look for a v4 tomorrow.
