After being burnt by a (virtual) SCSI disk recently, my
utilities now take a more aggressive approach to the data-in
buffer received from INQUIRY, MODE SENSE and LOG SENSE (and
probably should add a few more):

At a low level, after the command is completed, the data-in
buffer is post-filled with zeros following the last valid
byte as indicated by resid, until the end of that buffer.
Then it is passed back for higher level processing of the
command including its data-in buffer.

Pre-filling the data-in buffer with zeros has been in place
for a long time, but I don't think it helps much.


So if there are any HBA drivers that set resid higher than it
should be, expect some pain soon.
