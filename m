I see what you mean. Thanks.

I still don't like hooking timerfd in the interface. Besides the unclean
interface, it also feels cubersome and overkill to let users setup and add a
dedicated timerfd to implement timeout.

How about this:

int epoll_mod_wait(int epfd, struct epoll_mod_wait_data *data);

struct epoll_mod_wait_data {
	struct epoll_event *events;
	int maxevents;
	struct epoll_mod_cmd {
		int op,
		int fd;
		void *data;
	} *cmds;
	int ncmds;
	int flags;
	sigset_t *sigmask;
};

Commands ops are:

	EPOLL_CTL_ADD
		@fd is the fd to modify; @data is epoll_event.
	EPOLL_CTL_MOD
		@fd is the fd to modify; @data is epoll_event.
	EPOLL_CTL_DEL
		@fd is the fd to modify; @data is epoll_event.

	EPOLL_CTL_SET_TIMEOUT
		@fd is ignored, @data is timespec.
		Clock type and relative/absolute are selected by flags as below.

Flags are given to override timeout defaults:
	EPOLL_FL_MONOTONIC_CLOCK
		If set, don't use realtime clock, use monotonic clock.
	EPOLL_FL_ABSOLUTE_TIMEOUT
		If set, don't use relative timeout, use absolute timeout.

Thanks,
Fam
