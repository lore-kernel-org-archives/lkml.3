Yes, this should be a lot more "dynamic" in principle. A lightly-used
nfs server using workqueues should really not consume much at all in
the way of resources.

That's a good point. I had originally thought that max_active on an
unbound workqueue would be the number of concurrent jobs that could run
across all the CPUs, but now that I look I'm not sure that's really
the case.

Certainly, not bounding this at all has some appeal, but having some
limit here does help put an upper bound on the size of the svc_rqst
cache.

I'll definitely give that some thought.

That's my hope. We might also consider reaping idle rqsts ourselves
as needed somehow, but for now I decided not to worry about it until we
see whether this is really viable or not.

I've heard random grumblings from various people in the past that
workqueues have significant latency, but this is the first time I've
really hit it in practice. If we can get this fixed, then that may be a
significant perf win for all workqueue users. For instance, rpciod in
the NFS client is all workqueue-based. Getting that latency down could
really help things.

I'm currently trying to roll up a kernel module for benchmarking the
workqueue dispatching code in the hopes that we can use that to help
nail it down.

Thanks for having a look!
