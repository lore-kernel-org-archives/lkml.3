Well, any abstraction is good only if it isn't artificial, so solving more problems
than creating.

Reality is that de facto in the industry _SCSI_ is the abstraction for block/direct
access to data. Look around. How many of systems around you after all layers end up to
SCSI commands in their storage devices?

Linux block layer is purely artificial creature slowly reinventing wheel creating more
problems, than solving. It enforces approach, where often "impossible" means
"impossible in this interface". For instance, how about copy offload? How about
reservations? How about atomic writes? Look at history of barriers and compare then
with what can be done in SCSI. It's still worse, because doesn't allow usage of all
devices capabilities. Why was it needed to create special blk integrity interface with
the only end user - SCSI? Artificial task created - then well solved. Etc, etc.

The block layer keeps repeating SCSI. So, maybe, after all, it's better to acknowledge
that direct usage of SCSI without any intermediate layers and translations is more
productive? And for those minors not using SCSI internally, translate from SCSI to
their internal commands? Creating and filling CDB fields for most cases isn't anyhow
harder, than creating and feeling bio fields.

So, I appreciate work Paolo is doing in this direction. At least, the right thing will
be on the virtualization level.

I do understand that with all existing baggage replacing block layer by SCSI isn't
practical and not proposing it, but let's at least acknowledge limitations of the
academic block abstraction. Let's don't make those limitations global walls. Many
things better to do using direct SCSI, hence let's do the better way.
