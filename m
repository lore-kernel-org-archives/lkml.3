I'm not the selftests "maintainer", but I have written a bunch of code under
selftests, so the following is my 2c.

The barrier for entry to selftests should be as low as we can make it. Our
preference should always be for more tests, even if some of them start out a
bit crufty.

As such, requiring tests to produce perfectly formatted output or error codes
is the wrong approach in my opinion.

So ..

Yes I think so. I think at best we would hope for tests to converge on the
standard over time, but there will always be new tests arriving that are not so
well behaved.

One of the advantages of producing TAP or some other standard format would be
to avoid needing our own harness just to produce a summary.

We probably want to be able to do both of those.


FWIW, (most of) the tests under tools/testing/selftests/powerpc produce subunit
v1 output (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-subunit).

So you can do:

 $ cd tools/testing/selftests/powerpc
 $ make run_tests 2>&1 | subunit-1to2 | subunit-stats --no-passthrough
 Total tests:      32
 Passed tests:     32
 Failed tests:      0
 Skipped tests:     0
 Seen tags: git_version:next-20141209-0-g5348e33


subunit has the advantage over TAP IMO that it uses "success", "failure" and
"error" rather than "ok", "not ok".

There is now a subunit v2, which is a binary protocol. I don't think we want
a binary protocol, but it does have the advantage of being much more robust
than text based output.

cheers
