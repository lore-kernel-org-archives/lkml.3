The big problem with this approach is that not doing the
timestamp update on page faults is going to break the inode change
version counting because for ext4, btrfs and XFS it takes a
transaction to bump that counter. NFS needs to know the moment a
file is changed in memory, not when it is written to disk. Also, NFS
requires the change to the counter to be persistent over server
failures, so it needs to be changed as part of a transaction....

IOWs, fixing the "filesystems need a transaction on each page_mkwrite
call" problem isn't as simple as changing how timestamps are
updated.

Cheers,

Dave.
