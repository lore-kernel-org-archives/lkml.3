I'm reading the "only" in the first sentence:

"Servers SHOULD allow a user the ability to read the data of the file when only the ACE4_EXECUTE access mask bit is allowed."

But to entertain the idea that I'm reading too much into that sentence, let's go back to the situation:

File does not already exist
Application on client makes an open("/nfs4mnt/foo", O_CREAT | O_RDWR, 0) system call

What can we do between the server and client to assure success of that call. It works on local filesystems. It works over NFS v3. But it fails, at least with the Linux NFS v4 client.

With the Linux NFS v4 client, the following does succeed (because actual read access was granted):

open("/nfs4mnt/foo", O_CREAT | O_RDWR, 0400)

And the client can write to the file.

On the other hand, going back to my interpretation of the sentence, that is indeed the interpretation the Linux knfsd server is taking, because my little test case works as I expect it with the changes I proposed, in that and open("/nfs4mnt/foo", O_RDWR) fails even if the file has -wx------ permissions (and looking at wireshark traces, I see that indeed the OPEN fails if read permission is not granted, but execute permission is granted and write access was requested.

Ok, here is the relevant code from fs/nfsd/vfs.c:

        /* Allow read access to binaries even when mode 111 */
        if (err == -EACCES && S_ISREG(inode->i_mode) &&
             (acc == (NFSD_MAY_READ | NFSD_MAY_OWNER_OVERRIDE) ||
              acc == (NFSD_MAY_READ | NFSD_MAY_READ_IF_EXEC)))
                err = inode_permission(inode, MAY_EXEC);

So if the caller had requested write access, it does not check for MAY_EXEC.
