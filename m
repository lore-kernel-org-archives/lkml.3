I'd think that if they have customers that want to use Linux clients,
then those customers are likely to have more influence. This is entirely
a consequence of _their_ design decisions, quite frankly, since
returning NFS4ERR_DELAY in the above situation is downright silly. The
server designers _know_ that the RELEASE_LOCKOWNER will finish whatever
it is doing fairly quickly; it's not as if the CLOSE wouldn't have to do
the exact same state manipulations anyway...

Right, but my point above is that _in_general_ if we don't know why the
server is returning NFS4ERR_DELAY, then how can we attach any retry
numbers at all? HSM systems, for instance, have very different latencies
than the above and were the reason for inventing NFS3ERR_JUKEBOX in the
first place.

We could change nfs4_async_handle_error() to take a struct
nfs4_exception, just like nfs4_handle_exception() does; at some point we
can use that to unify the two.
Just store the timeout somewhere in the nfs4_closedata.
