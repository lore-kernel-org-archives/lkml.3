Hmm.

This issue certainly makes fexecve or execveat less attractive, at
least in cases where d_path won't work.

On the other hand, if you want to run a static binary on a cloexec fd
(or, for that matter, a dynamic binary if you trust the interpreter to
close the extra copy of the fd it gets) in a namespace or chroot where
the binary is invisible, then you need kernel help.

It's too bad that script interpreters don't have a mechanism to open
their scripts by fd.

This still has issues with locks if you pass an fd to a child process,
but I guess that you get what you ask for if you do that.

Fair enough.
