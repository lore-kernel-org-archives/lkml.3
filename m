Hi Linus,

This is the first pull request I've had to do for you, so I'm still
sorting things out. The reason I'm sending this and not Ben should
be obvious from the first commit below - SGI has stepped down from
the XFS maintainership role. As such, I'd like to take another
opportunity to thank them for their many years of effort maintaining
XFS and supporting the XFS community that they developed from the
ground up.

So I haven't had time to work things like signed tags into my
workflows yet, so this is just a repo branch I'm asking you to pull
from. And yes, I named the branch -rc4 because I wanted the fixes in
-rc4, not because the branch was for merging into -rc3. Probably not
right, either.

Anyway, I should have everything sorted out by the time the next
merge window comes around. If there's anything that you don't like
in the pull req, feel free to flame me unmercifully.

The changes are fixes for recent regressions and important thinkos
in verification code:

	- a log vector buffer alignment issue on ia32
	- timestamps on truncate got mangled
	- primary superblock CRC validation fixes and error message
	  sanitisation

Cheers,

Dave.
