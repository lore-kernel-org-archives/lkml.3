For what it's worth, I've seen a report of a case where a storage array
returned a CHECK CONDITION with invalid sense data, which caused the
command to be retried indefinitely.  I'm not sure what you can do about
this, if the device won't ever complete a command without an error.
Perhaps it should be offlined after sufficiently bad behavior.

I don't think you want to panic on an error, though.  In a clustered
environment it is possible that the other systems will all fail in the
same way, for example.
