Ah thanks David for looking at this.

Sorry for the thin paragraphs my vim was warming too early about long
lines. I will reformat it to break at 74 chars.

No problem, I'll redo everything so it is one function per patch. Now
fair warning: there are about 102 functions to cleanup. I was a bit
worried that many patches would cause too much maintainer overhead but
it is no problem for me. Only a few functions have dependecies on
other functions needing cleanup. Thus there will be some small patch
series for those function sets. A big benefit of one function one
patch is that extent-io.c will no longer be a 34 function monster
patch.

Thank you David, I'll redo all these patches.

Is there any rate limiting I should be doing? I don't want to flood
the list with burst of dozen plus patches, or is that an okay volume?

Daniel
