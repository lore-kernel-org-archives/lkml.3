Yes, which is why I've been accepting his kernel patches the entire time
that user-space has been forked into -fb.  Now that the user-space code
has been relicensed as promised, there is no longer any reason for a
separate -fb fork to exist.

That said, it's time to start moving forward toward a single set of
source trees for upstream userspace, so that all distributions can
mutually benefit from the effort.  As mentioned above, this has so far
not been enough to get -fb reconciled with upstream.

So I don't consider the above 'holding for ransom' or any nonsense like
that, considering the end goal is for everyone (not just Fedora) to
benefit from -fb.
