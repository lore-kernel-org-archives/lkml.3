I too have seen this.

My system is:

   12 CPU Octeon (MIPS64)
   Root is ext3, mounted via ext4fs on a slow CompactFlash/PIO6

I saw the crash when simply booting  a fairly bare-bones Debian distro, 
although it is somewhat random:
.
.
ata3: PATA max PIO6 cmd 900000001d040000 ctl 900000001d05000d irq 63
.
.
ata3.00: CFA: CF 4GB, 20101001, max UDMA/133
ata3.00: 7847280 sectors, multi 0: LBA
ata3.00: configured for PIO6
.
.
scsi 2:0:0:0: Direct-Access     ATA      CF 4GB           2010 PQ: 0 ANSI: 5
sd 2:0:0:0: [sda] 7847280 512-byte logical blocks: (4.01 GB/3.74 GiB)
sd 2:0:0:0: [sda] Write Protect is off
sd 2:0:0:0: [sda] Write cache: disabled, read cache: enabled, doesn't 
support DPO or FUA
  sda: sda1 sda2
sd 2:0:0:0: [sda] Attached SCSI disk
EXT4-fs (sda2): mounting ext3 file system using the ext4 subsystem
EXT4-fs (sda2): mounted filesystem with ordered data mode. Opts: (null)
VFS: Mounted root (ext3 filesystem) readonly on device 8:2.
.
.
.

I have not been able to get it to fail a second time.  So for me 
bisecting might not work.
