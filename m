Why complicate the things? Following this logic you can change you
can change almost every user of, say, fatal_signal_pending() to take
TIF_MEMDIE into account. For what? Just return -EINTR.

Who else? I mean, who else doesn't handle SIGKILL correctly ?

Well. I do not know if user-space should be blamed or not. But. The worker
process was killed, the kernel has all rights to check signal_pending() at
any moment and return to user-mode. Even if we change kthread_create() to
ignore SIGKILL it still can fail.

And probably there is a bug in the driver. IIUC, the probe hangs, the task
is killed after 30 seconds, I'd say it should not even call scsi_host_alloc()
in this case.

OK, scsi_host_alloc() fails. But it can fail due to another reason,

and why the error path should OOPS? I think this should be fixed?

I still can't understand why do you think we should "fix" kthread_create().

Personally I dislike both. It should either react to SIGKILL or not, in the
latter case it would be better to revert this patch, imho.

If we need the urgent hack to fix the regression, then I suggest to change
scsi_host_alloc() temporary until mptsas (or whatever) is fixed.

Oleg.
