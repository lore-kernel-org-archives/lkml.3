I agree that 8 bits is pretty low and more would be better.  However,
even 8 bits provides a < 1% chance that any particular guess will be
correct.  Combined with kernel crash monitoring, this amount of ASLR
means that brute-force attacks can't occur undetectably, even if they
can eventually be successful.  Having a signal that indicates an
attack-in-progress is a pretty big leg up from not.  Of course,
infoleaks would render this whole discussion moot, but I'm replying to
the "only 8 bits" part here.

Without increasing the entropy bits, does this actually increase the #
of tries necessary for an attacker to guess correctly?  It
dramatically increases the number of possible configurations of kernel
address space, but for any given piece there are only 256 possible
locations.

I attempted to do this, but was limited by my knowledge of the
toolchain.  I would welcome help or suggestions!
