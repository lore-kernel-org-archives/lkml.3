Yes, this is why I repopulate resource->start and ->end after
add_io_space().

Thanks for sharing and let me know some background about this. Honestly,
I just change the code just according to the original. It's good to have
a chance to see such kind of machine's acpidump.

I wonder why current code doesn't check _TTP? The code in the
add_io_space() seems to think _TTP is always set, right?
