Yes, that would be good. NFS v4 allows upgrade/downgrade of acces/deny modes
(hmm, changing access mode would be trickier, but we need to be able to
upgrade/downgrade those as well as deny modes...). It could still be done
with an fcntl.  I don't know if any NFS clients make use of
upgrade/downgrade (I do know there are pynfs tests for it).

Interestingly, upgrade/downgrade would be a solution to Ganesha's problems
with POSIX locks being dumped on any file descriptor close since we could
change the access mode as needed rather than needing to close and open the
file.
