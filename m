By then, it might be too late.  It would be really sad to find ourselves
forced to return ENOSYS to getrandom(GRND_RANDOM) when we actually wanted to
return EPERM/EACCES.

Actually, we might not be able to do even that much: all it takes is for
someone to have the bright idea of deploying userspace code that checks for
ENOSYS only on a first "probe" getrandom() syscall without GRND_RANDOM, and
does something idiotic when it gets ENOSYS later on a
getrandom(GRND_RANDOM).  meh.  We can't even abuse the system ourselves :-)

That will teach people to not have a SIGALRM on code that calls a blocking
syscall, I suppose.  Still, there is a risk it could cause so much bad
application behaviour to the point of being unusable.

Indeed :p
