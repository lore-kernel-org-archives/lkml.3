Although it required hand merging, this large patch is now merged into
cifs-2.6.git (for-next branch, destined for 3.10) but ... I only
merged three obvious other patches (destined for 3.10) before it

4521ba9ca4138f424769f17ae7166ff5ccf08805 fs: cifs: use kmemdup instead
of kmalloc + memcpy
41057e5a5d673015fc0d0e587e993d26f1818b1c cifs: replaced kmalloc +
memset with kzalloc
8f43465d17982767dd5b3f5d48216ef5c100c274 cifs: ignore the unc= and
prefixpath= mount options

and I merged one so far after it that Jeff had already rebased ontop
of Joe's large patch

457d2157ec2da6f9fa755e16ab740979f581e328 cifs: remove ENOSPC handling
in smb_sendv

So ... going forward for 3.10 make sure to fixup subsequent new cifs
patches ontop Joe's large "cifs: Rename cERROR and cFYI to cifs_dbg"
patch or else it will make merging a mess since Joe's patch changes
just about very cifs file due to the macro renaming.
