Yes - because if you think about it that tells you that nobody is hitting
it with the old code and it probably doesn't matter.

That's not a statistically valid sample size btw

Plus as I pointed out (and you ignored) you are shutting out any future
processors with this kind of oddity, and you have not audited all the
embedded devices we support or may support in future.

That's why many many years ago we added set_bit() and the other bit
functions. On sane processors they are very fast. On insane ones they
work. They understand byte tearing, they understand store ordering (which
a simple variable does not so you've got to audit all your memory
barriers too). In many cases they are faster than using memory barriers
to guide the compiler because they invalidate less and allow the compiler
more freedom.

All this started because I suggested you use set_bit and friends and for
some reason you've decided to try and find another way to do it. We have
the bit operations for a reason. On x86 they are very very fast, on
uniprocessor anything they are very fast, on multiprocessor in general
they are very fast, or you are dealing with boxes that have sanity
problems of other kinds.
