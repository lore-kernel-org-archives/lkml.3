You've obviously been involved in this area a lot more closely than me,
so I'll defer to your experience. :)

I think that if that's the intended use case, then the spec wording could
be improved.  Looking at "sbc3r36.pdf", it still only explicitly mentions
performance penalties for transfers that are larger than the "optimal
transfer length", not for transfers that are smaller.

Both.  I didn't do it myself, but the guy who did sent me the following:

Apparently the "hdparm -I" command is giving bogus data as well.
I've seen that happen if the drive is on a RAID controller--I assume
that could cause problems with firmware updates too?
