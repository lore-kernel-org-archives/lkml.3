Does it? Are we talking about the same patch here?
https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/12/12/174

Which depends on yours only to revert your part. I plan to repost it but
that still doesn't mean it will get merged because Johannes still has
some argumnets against. I would like to start the discussion again
because now we are so deep in circles that it is hard to come up with a
reasonable outcome. It is still hard to e.g. agree on an actual fix
for a real problem https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/12/12/129.

While notification might be an issue as well it is more of a corner case
than a regular one. So let's try to move on, agree on the "oom vs.
PF_EXITING) first and lay out discussion for the notification in a new
threa. Shall we?
