The problem should be gone in 3.16.0. I was asking because the 2 commits 
bd01ec1a13 and 70af2f8a4f are the two consecutive qrwlock patches. The 
first one adds the code while the second one enables its use in x86. So 
if you just compare these two commits, you will certainly see some 
regressions in the test.
