3.6.11.9-rc1 stable review patch.
If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Tejun Heo <tj@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 7a87718d92760fc688628ad6a430643dafa16f1f ]

For some reason, a lot of port-multipliers have issues with softreset.
SIMG [34]7x series port-multipliers have been quite erratic in this
regard.  I recall that it was better with some firmware revisions and
the current list of quirks worked fine for a while.  I think it got
worse with later firmwares or maybe my test coverage wasn't good
enough.  Anyways, HPA is reporting that his 3726 setup suffers SRST
failures and then the PMP gets confused and fails to probe the last
port.

The hope was that we try to stick to the standard as much as possible
and soonish the PMPs and their firmwares will improve in quality, so
the quirk list was kept to minimum.  Well, it seems like that's never
gonna happen.

Let's set NO_SRST for all [34]7x PMPs so that whatever remaining
userbase of the device suffer the least.  Maybe we should do the same
for 57xx's but unfortunately I don't have any device left to test and
I'm not even sure 57xx's have ever been made widely available, so
let's leave those alone for now.
