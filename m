Yeah, I could use that. But since this is used in arch-independent code (e.g. IA64
needs similar macro), I think we'd better define function_entry() in asm/types.h for
general use (for kallsyms), and rename ppc_function_entry to local_function_entry()
in asm/code-patching.h.

Ah, those messages should be shown in dmesg when booting if it doesn't work,
because the messages are printed by initialization process of kprobe blacklist.
So, reproducing it is just enabling CONFIG_KPROBES and boot it.

Thank you,
