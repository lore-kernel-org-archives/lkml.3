Sure. This test doesn't really cost us anything, so I think I'd feel a little
better just leaving it in. I'll add a comment for the next close reader.

Besides that and Filipe's response, I'll address everything you mentioned here

I'll definitely take a closer look at this. In particular,
btrfs_get_blocks_direct and btrfs_get_extent do allocations in some cases which
I'll look into.
