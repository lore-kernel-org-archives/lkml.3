I'd like to understand the problem better. Could you please provide any 
details about that data corruption? And if it was already discussed 
somewhere, please point me to there.

There seems to be two different problems: 1) pages backed by already 
freed blocks; 2) keeping page-cache populated by pages with stale data 
after fallocate completes. Your concerns refer to the first problem. My 
patch was intended to resolve the second. It seems to me that my patch 
really fixes the second problem and it doesn't make things worse w.r.t. 
the fisrt problem. Do I miss something?

Thanks,
Maxim
