There will be userlands that will depend on kdbus, but that will still
not turn the "driver" into a core Linux kernel feature. We really want
it to be losely coupled from the rest of the kernel and optional after
all. The kernel people are working toward making more and more things
optional these days, and there will still be lots of systems that won't
be using kdbus.

It emphasizes the fact that our ioctl API can only be used with the
nodes exposed by kdbusfs, and vice versa. I think operations on
driver-specific files do not justify a new 'generic' syscall API.

I don't see how ioctls are any worse than syscalls with pointers to
structures. One can screw up compatibility either way. How is an ioctl
wrapper/prototype any less type-safe than a syscall wrapper?

And how are syscalls different in that regard when they would both
transport the same data structures? Also note that all kdbus ioctls
necessarily operate on a file descriptor context, which an ioctl passes
along by default.

Adding another ioctl in the future for cases we didn't think about
earlier would of course be considered a workaround; and even though such
things happen all the time, it's certainly something we'd like to avoid.

However, we would also need to add another syscall in such cases, which
is even worse IMO. So that's really not an argument against ioctls after
all. What fundamental difference between a raw syscall and a ioctl,
especially with regards to type safety, is there which would help us here?

Yes, we've jointly reviewed the API details again until just recently to
unify structs and enums etc, and added fields to make the ioctls structs
more versatile for possible future additions. By that, we effectively
broke the ABI, but we did that because we know we can't do such things
again in the future.

But again - I don't see how this would be different when using syscalls
rather than ioctls to transport information between the driver and
userspace. Could you elaborate?

Fair enough. Everything that helps people understand and use the API in
a sane way is a good thing to have, and so is getting an assessment from
people how are exposed to this API for the first time.

We'll be working on restructuring the documentation.


Thanks,
Daniel
