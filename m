Sounds reasonable.

The problem with that approach is that the execed program now has its
current directory outside the sandbox, which could be problematic if
you don't trust that program.

It can always be added later

Do you have an ETA?  If it's likely to miss 3.19, but if you'll have
time to review before then, I can try to do it.

OK, I'll bite.  How feasible would it be to have a flag that activated
pid_ns_for_children?  That would reduce a lot of the ugliness in tools
like nsenter that need to fork to enter a pid ns.

I always assume that the reason for the active vs. for_children
distinction was because a lot of userspace libraries, including glibc,
would malfunction if getpid(2) started returning a different value.
But, for exec, this doesn't matter.
