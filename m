Our expectation for NFS4ERR_DELAY event that are not listed in
RFC3530/RFC5661 is that it should be rare, but is expected on average to
last significantly longer than an RPC round-trip between the server and
client.
The other constraint was that we needed a number which is shorter than
the lease period so that we don't have to keep sending RENEWs. 

The 2 main cases we thought we'd have to deal with were:

- HSM systems fetching data from a tape backup or something similar
- Idmappers needing to refill their cache from LDAP/NIS/...

We did not expect servers to be using NFS4ERR_DELAY as a generic tool
for avoiding mutexes. That sounds like great a business opportunity for
the network switch vendors, but a poor one for everyone else...
