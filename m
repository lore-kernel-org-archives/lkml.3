Seccomp can't really restrict lookups of non-self pids.  In fact, this
feature idea started out as a response to a patch adding a kind of
nasty seccomp feature to make it sort of possible.

I agree that that seccomp can turn off GRND_RANDOM, but how is it
supposed to do it in such a way that the filtered software will fall
back to something sensible?  -ENOSYS?  -EPERM?  Something else?

I think that -ENOSYS is clearly wrong, but standardizing this would be
nice.  Admittedly, adding something fancy like this for GRND_RANDOM
may not be appropriate.
