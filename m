Ok, I'm not 100% sure it was 3.17-rcX... but according to logs, it
is. 3.17-rc4

No, I don't think it is repeatable in useful way for debugging, but it
is not first time it happened here. No LVM or dm-crypt in use.

I tried to search syslog, but could not find original messages. It
happened during shutdown. I guess syslog was already stopped at that
point..>?

Too late for that :-(.

Debian testing was 3.17-rc4, AFAICT. For debian stable -- not sure.

Is there some phase during shutdown where journalling no longer
protects fs integrity?
