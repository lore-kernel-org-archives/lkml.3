You're right, but I'm also right, because __d_find_alias() will check
IS_ROOT() too.  So only "root" disconnected dentries will be moved.

What I meant is that d_materialise_unique() will currently not reuse
disconnected *nondirectory* dentries, hence there may be more aliases
than necessary.  This could easily be fixed, though.
