For all that is sacred, STOP.

Go and do something else, you are wasting people's valuable time,

Don't send any patches you haven't tested ever. If you aren't capable
of setting up a VM to run compressed btrfs volumes in, what makes you
think you can patch the code.

This isn't how you learn to be a kernel developer by wasting other
kernel developers time, if you can't work out why releasing the page cache
is necessary then don't send the patch until you have spent the time
understanding what the page cache is.

I know you'll just ignore this, and keep on trucking just like you ignored
the other messages from Stephen before.

But if you want to work on the kernel, this isn't the way to do it, and
nobody will ever take a patch from you seriously if you continue in this
fashion.

Dave.
