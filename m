I agree intuition may not count, and it's perfectly possible that
firmware writers forgot a "break;" or put the wrong location in a jump
table, so that unimplemented commands give interesting results.

However, the _fact_ is that this might happen anyway with the buttload
of commands that are already enabled by the whitelist and that most
disks will never implement.

No, it is not unfortunately.  Allowing to do discards is one thing,
allowing to disrupt the settings of a SAN is another.  You can only
delegate the device fully in these cases:

(a) of course, if the guest is trusted;

(b) if QEMU is running as a confined user, then you can get by with a
userspace whitelist.  (Otherwise you're just a ptrace away from
arbitrary access, as you pointed out).

Unfortunately, there are _real_ problems that this patches fix, such as
log spews due to blocked commands, and these happen even if neither of
the above conditions is true.

Is there anything else I can do?  Sure, I can check for the presence of
the whitelist and hack the VPD pages to hide features that I know the
whitelist will block.  Is it the right thing to do?  In my opinion no.
It makes no sense to have raw device access _disable_ features compared
to emulation.

I actually agree, and that's why I'm trying to balance the widening and
restricting.
