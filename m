Well every time in the past that Al Viro looked in its direction he broke
it so probably. Someone is going to have to clean up or fix the fact it
pokes around in the depths of the low level fd I/O code and calls stuff
like __fd_install and __alloc_fd directly, or mend it if it breaks.

I'm curious what Al Viro thinks of it

So what is the Android side model for its security. That probably also
should be described so nobody goes off and uses it for something like
systemd because "it looked neat".

95% of those devices are locked down, most of them have non replaceable
batteries that will dead and irreplacable (sanely anyway) in 3-5 years.
"Forever" in the phone world is mercifully rather short.
