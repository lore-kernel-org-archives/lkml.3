Subject: [PATCH v4 2/2] blk-throttle: trim tokens generated for an idle tree

Why
====
Pointed out by Vivek: Tokens generated during idle period should
be trimmed. Otherwise a huge bio may be permited immediately.
Overlimit behaviour may be observed during short I/O throughput
test.

Vivek also pointed out: We should not over-trim for hierarchical
groups. Suppose a subtree of groups are idle when a big bio comes.
The token of the child group is trimmed and not enough. So the bio is
queued on the child group. After some jiffies the child group reserved
enough tokens and the bio climbs up. If we trim the parent group at
this time again, this bio will wait too much time than expected.

Analysis
========
When the bio is queued on child group, all it's ancestor groups
becomes non-idle. They should start to reserve tokens for that
bio from this moment. And their reserved tokens before should be
trimmed at this moment.

How
====
service_queue now has a new member nr_queued_tree[2], to represent
the the number of bios waiting on the subtree rooted by this sq.

When a bio is queued on the hierarchy first time, nr_queued_tree
of all ancestors and the child group itself are increased. When a
bio climbs up, nr_queued_tree of the child group is decreased.

When nr_queued_tree turns from zero to one, the tokens reserved
before are trimmed. And after this switch, this group will never
be trimmed to reserve tokens for the bio waiting on it's descendant
group.
