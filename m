No worries. As you can see, I'm not quick answering either :/

That's interesting. I know that the problem was reproducable on xfs at
some point, but that was on 2.6.18 or so...

I'll try whether I can make it perform badly on the measly hardware I
have available.

And will check whether it's potentially related to that.

I've seen *much* worse cases than this, but it's what we're seing in
production.

I'll try starting a benchmark of actual postgres showing the differnt
peak/average throughput and latencies.

I've essentially given up on btrfs for the forseeable future :(.

I've CCed the ext4 list and Ted. Maybe that'll bring some insigh...

There's a *lot* of busy postgres installations out there running on a
single disk of spinning rust. Hopefully replicating to another piece of
spinning rust... In comparison to that that's enterprise hardware ;)
