Subject: [PATCH 01/11] x86: sysfb: fool-proof CONFIG_X86_SYSFB

Turns out, people do not read help-texts of new config-options and enable
them nonetheless. So several reports came in with X86_SYSFB=y and
FB_SIMPLE=n, which in almost all situations prevents firmware-fbs from
being probed.

X86_SYSFB clearly states that it turns legacy vesa/efi framebuffers into a
format compatible to simplefb (and does nothing else..). So to avoid
further complaints about missing gfx-support during boot, simply depend on
FB_SIMPLE now.
As FB_SIMPLE is disabled by default and usually only enabled on selected
ARM architectures, x86 users should thus never see the X86_SYSFB
config-option. And if they do, everything is fine as simplefb will be
available.

Note that most of the sysfb code is enabled independently of X86_SYSFB.
The config option only selects a compatibility mode for simplefb. It was
introduced to ease the transition to SimpleDRM and disabling fbdev. As
this is still ongoing, there's no need for non-developers to care for
X86_SYSFB so we can safely hide it behind FB_SIMPLE.
