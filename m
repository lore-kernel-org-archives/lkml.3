Next version of the same patchset.  Object size is shrinking now, at
least for the one compiler I tested.  And a few kernel hackers met on
a frozen lake in hell with pigs flying overhead and could actually
agree on a name.  While I am sure almost every reader will still
disagree and have one or two better suggestions, I would like to use
this historical moment.

list_del_each and list_del_each_entry is shall be!
