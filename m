In order for compression to be a net win an application should be aware of what is being compressed and what isn't. For example patterns for IO on large libraries (eg 30mb libxul.so) are well suited to compression, but SQLite databases are not.  Similarly for our disk cache: images should not be compressed, but javascript should be. Footprint wins are useful on android, but it's the increased IO throughput on crappy storage devices that makes this most attractive.

We are discussing not about good or bad idea. We need to elaborate a
right solution. I think that suggested idea is not clear. Do you want to
support compression in ext4? Or do you want to add some new compression
feature (likewise file-oriented compression)? If we are talking about
compression in ext4 then it needs to use e2compr patch set. Otherwise,
if we are talking about file compression then it is not question of
concrete filesystem. And we need to make implementation on VFS level. It
is only architectural point of view.

Why do you try to implement likewise concept on kernel level? It looks
like you try to move some user-space concept in kernel-space.

With the best regards,
