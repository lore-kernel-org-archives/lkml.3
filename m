Not exactly.  More details below.

Instead of depending on CONFIG_USB_PERSIST, the power/persist attribute
depends on CONFIG_PM.  But pointing that out would be redundant, since
the power/ device directory itself doesn't exist unless CONFIG_PM is
enabled.

The default value for the persist facility depends on the setting of 
CONFIG_USB_DEFAULT_PERSIST.  If that symbol is set then persist is 
enabled by default for all devices, except those which have the 
USB_QUIRK_RESET flag set (meaning that they will morph or change modes 
when reset).  If the symbol is not set then persist is enabled by 
default only for hubs.

Thanks for the documentation update.
