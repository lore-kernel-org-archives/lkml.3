Do we need new flags at all? If both fds refer to files, then perhaps
we can just take it that SPLICE_F_DIRECT behavior is implied?

I'd probably suggest that we not add any more flags than are necessary
until use-cases for them become clear.

Agreed.

On the whole, the concept looks sound.

I'll note too that by simply lifting the restriction that one of the
fd's to splice must always be a pipe, that may also give us a relatively
simple way to add recvfile() as well, even if only as a macro wrapper
around splice(). That's been a long sought-after feature of the samba
developers...

Just allow userland to do a splice straight from a socket fd to a file.
We may end up having to copy data if the alignment isn't right, but it'd
still be valuable to do that directly in the kernel in a single syscall.
