Exactly, I'm concerned about the use case: readers can't starve writers.
Of course, lots of existing readers can temporarily prevent a writer from
acquiring, but those readers would already have the lock. Any new readers
wouldn't be able to prevent a waiting writer from obtaining the lock.

Josef,
Could you be more explicit, maybe with some detailed numbers about the
condition you report?

I say that because a subtle bug that could mistakenly wait a reader
existed in the rwsem implementation until relatively recently. Is there
some other lurking problem?

Michel,

I'm glad you point out a much better approach --- but why are we
considering open-coding down_read_trylock()/down_write_trylock?
