Why do we need a new ioctl to do this? fadvise64() seems like it's
the exact fit for "FADV_INVALIDATE_[META]DATA" flags...

And before anyone shouts "posix_fadvise sucks!" note that I'm
talking about adding flags to the syscall that the kernel defines,
not the glibc posix wrapper....

Cheers,

Dave.
