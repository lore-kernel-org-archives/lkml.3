A naive implementation is obviously less-than-efficient. However, what
other problems exist with the libata QC tag allocator? I highly doubt
SATA will change to beyond 32 queue tags, primarily because it would
be a pain to change SDB FIS (it's likely to break the dozens of AHCI
controller implementations out there). Further, it seems like the
industry stopped caring about SATA and is pushing NVMe for future
offerings.

In any event, most modern systems should have instructions to count
leading zeroes and modify bits atomically.
