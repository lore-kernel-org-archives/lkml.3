Hmmm...  It is a bit ambiguous.  How about the following?

documentation: Record limitations of bitfields and small variables

This commit documents the fact that it is not safe to use bitfields
as shared variables in synchronization algorithms.  It also documents
that CPUs must provide one-byte and two-byte normal load and store
instructions in order to be supported by the Linux kernel.  (Michael
Cree has agreed to the resulting non-support of pre-EV56 Alpha CPUs:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/9/5/143.)

+ (*) These guarantees do not apply to bitfields, because compilers often
+     generate code to modify these using non-atomic read-modify-write
+     sequences.  Do not attempt to use bitfields to synchronize parallel
+     algorithms.
+
+ (*) Even in cases where bitfields are protected by locks, all fields
+     in a given bitfield must be protected by one lock.  If two fields
+     in a given bitfield are protected by different locks, the compiler's
+     non-atomic read-modify-write sequences can cause an update to one
+     field to corrupt the value of an adjacent field.
+
+ (*) These guarantees apply only to properly aligned and sized scalar
+     variables.  "Properly sized" currently means variables that are
+     the same size as "char", "short", "int" and "long".  "Properly
+     aligned" means the natural alignment, thus no constraints for
+     "char", two-byte alignment for "short", four-byte alignment for
+     "int", and either four-byte or eight-byte alignment for "long",
+     on 32-bit and 64-bit systems, respectively.  Note that this means
+     that the Linux kernel does not support pre-EV56 Alpha CPUs,
+     because these older CPUs do not provide one-byte and two-byte
+     load and store instructions.  (In theory, the pre-EV56 Alpha CPUs
+     can emulate these instructions using load-linked/store-conditional
+     instructions, but in practice this approach has excessive overhead.
+     Keep in mind that this emulation would be required on -all- single-
+     and double-byte loads and stores in order to handle adjacent bytes
+     protected by different locks.)
+
+     Alpha EV56 and later Alpha CPUs are still supported.
