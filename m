In principle it should be only called for new file mappings
getting maped.  Do you really have that many new file mappings all
the time? Or is this related to program startup?

The paper was before Nick Piggin's RCU (and our) work on this.
Modern kernels do not have dcache problems with mosbench, unless
you run weird security modules like SMACK that effectively 
disable dcache RCU.

BTW lock elision may fix these problems anyways, in a much
simpler way.
