I note for the record I'm trying to get basic Alpha support working in
http://landley.net/aboriginal/about.html now that qemu at least offers
a qemu-system-alpha, and if I do get it working I may take a stab at
adding alpha support to musl-libc.

It's not just that I want to get cross platform testing of package
builds working on a convenient/reproducible/portable way on as many
different targets as I can. My project is designed the way it is
because I think losing the ability to reproduce things from first
principles (and thus understand why it was done that way in the first
place) is a _bad_idea_. And an increasingly real-world problem, see
http://wrttn.in/04af1a for example. (And the way NASA lost the plans
for the Saturn V rocket... In fact scientists' general disinclination
to reproduce old experimental results to see if they were actually
true or not comes up on a regular basis, most recent I saw was
http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health/the-curious-case-of-the-cyclists-unshaved-legs/article20370814/
)

Of course Peter has consistently dismissed my concerns as "academic":

http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0802.1/4400.html

Personally, I hope the projects I work on _do_ outlive me, an try to
make it easy for newbies to recapitulate phylogeny. That's why I
thought requiring perl dependencies to build was a bad idea, and why I
thought removing 386 support entirely (instead of restricting it to
UP) was a bad idea. The idea that Linux no longer needs to build on
the original machine Linus designed it for, and now it no longer needs
to work on the machine the "arch" directory was created for (and the
first 64 bit machine)... These positions would appear to have a single
consistent proponent, with whom I disagree.

Oh well, just wanted to get that out there,

Rob
