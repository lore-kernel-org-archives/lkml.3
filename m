It is probably easier to get access to a Power system (gcc compile farm?).
Having said that, there is a service available to get access to a System z
for open source development:
http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/z/os/linux/support/community.html

When we did the valgrind port we used that a lot to gave access to 
non-IBMers.
Dont know if it is ok to install a private kernel, though. Will double
check.
