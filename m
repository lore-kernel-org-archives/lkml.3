This is causes a rather inconsistent behavior in that it doesn't
account of the amount of time left on the hb timer.  Thus it doesn't
always do what commit log implies.  If the remaining time is shorter
then the new timeout value, it will take longer till the next HB
the application expects.

If the application has very strict timing requirement on the HBs, it
should trigger the HB manually.

We could rework the code to allow the combination of
SPP_HB_DEMAND | SPP_HB_ENABLE to work as follows:
  1) update the timer to the new value
  2) Send an immediate HB
     a) Update the hb timeout.

2a should probably be done regardless since it can cause 2 HB to be
outstanding at the same time.
