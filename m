Right. Until someone comes along and installs a package that
uses groups in this particular way. You can't count on the fact
that someone isn't using it in that particular way today as an
indicator that they won't tomorrow. Are you thinking about providing
a tool that will tell sysadmins whether or not their system is safe
to use this option? Certainly you are going to suggest that most
sysadmins would know how to figure out if it is safe to use this
option.

The developers of user namespaces didn't notice it might be a problem.
You can't count on sysadmins or distro developers to do better.
