In general, holding a lock and freezing can cause a deadlock if:

1) you froze via the cgroup_freezer subsystem and a task in another
cgroup tried to acquire the same lock
2) the lock was needed later is suspend/hibernate. For example, if the
lock was needed in dpm_suspend by one of the device callbacks. For
hibernate, you also need to worry about any locks that need to be
acquired in order to write to the swap device.
3) another freezing task blocked on this lock and held other locks
needed later in suspend. If that task were skipped by the freezer, you
would deadlock

You will block/prevent suspend if:

4) another freezing task blocked on this lock and was unable to freeze

I think 1) and 4) can happen for the NFS/RPC case. Case 1) requires
cgroup freezer. Case 4) while not causing a deadlock could prevent
your laptop/phone from sleeping and end up burning all your battery.
If suspend is initiated via lid close you won't even know about the
failure.
