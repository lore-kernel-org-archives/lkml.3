I am actually in disagreement with you, Thierry. I don't like the general direction
of the patches, or at least I don't like the fact that we don't have a portable
way of setting up the msi_chip without having to rely on weak architectural hooks.
I'm surprised no one considers the case of a platform having more than one host
bridge and possibly more than one MSI unit. With the current proposed patchset I
can't see how that would work.

What I would like to see is a way of creating the pci_host_bridge structure outside
the pci_create_root_bus(). That would then allow us to pass this sort of platform
details like associated msi_chip into the host bridge and the child busses will
have an easy way of finding the information needed by finding the root bus and then
the host bridge structure. Then the generic pci_scan_root_bus() can be used by (mostly)
everyone and the drivers can remove their kludges that try to work around the
current limitations.

Best regards,
Liviu
