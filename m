Understood, but the benefit is slight and the cost (in complexity) is
rather large.  On balance I'd far prefer to get rid of any fallback code
entirely.

Yes.  I don't know if anyone's tested them in recent memory!  But it
might be interesting to write a few simple tests for them and hook them
up to this on the server side.  (I don't know if they'd be worth
implementing on the client side?)
