Well, when I got report about hw problems, badblocks -c was my first
instinct. On the usb hdd, the most errors were due to 3.16-rc1 kernel
bug, not real problems.

Actually, badblocks is really tricky to use, I'd not trust myself to
get parameters right.

Well, 500GB disk takes a while to back up, plus you need the space. a)
will take few hours... And sometimes, data are much less valuable then
the HDD. I do have 2 copies of data I care about, using unison to keep
it in sync, and I plan to add 3rd, encrypted copy to Seagate Momentus
5400.6 series that failed (a). It seems that Seagate just got their
firmware wrong, while in thinkpad, the drive worked very much ok, with
exception with few sectors that could not be remapped. Now, USB
envelope seems to be much harsher evnironment for a HDD, and it has
few more bad sectors now, but that's somehow expected. I was not
treating the hdd as if it had valuable data.

So... please keep fsck -c :-).

[Actually, badblocks documentation leaves something to be desired.
Is ^C safe w.r.t. badblocks -n? Is hard poweroff safe?]

Thanks,

(Actually it looks I forgot to free the badlist. Incremental patch:)
