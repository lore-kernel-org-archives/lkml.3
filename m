If the iclog list is corrupt and not circular, then we will simply
panic the next time it is iterated. Lots of log code iterates the
iclog list, such as log IO completion, switching iclogs, log forces,
etc.

Yes, but to continue the Devil's Advocate argument, the purpose of
debug code isn't to enlightent the casual reader or drive-by
patchers - it's to make life easier for people who actually spend
time debugging the code. And the people who need the debug code
are expected to understand why an ASSERT is not necessary. :)

Cheers,

Dave.
