Looks much less intrusive to me, and doesn't appear to affect any
other filesystem or the recursion patterns of memory reclaim,
so I like it very much more than the previous patchset. Nice work!
:)

The code changes are really outside my area of expertise now, so I
don't really feel qualified to review the changes. However, consider
the overall approach:

Acked-by: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>
