A bit of context: p is a local pointer to struct file here and alloc is
opening it...

First of all, this "p->foo = 1" is a shorthand for initialization of
struct file done by opening a file.  What you are saying is that it
can leak past the point where we stick a pointer to freshly opened
file into a place where another CPU can see it, but not past the
barrier in dropping the lock, right?

And you are suggesting rcu_dereference() as a way to bring the required
barriers in.  Ouch...  The names are really bad, but there's another
fun issue - rcu_dereference brings in sparse noise.  Wouldn't direct use
of smp_read_barrier_depends() be cleaner, anyway?
