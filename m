Ahh. And that was actually what you had done the first time around for
your test too - but back then I didn't actually *merge* it. Then I
just looked at the top commit and said "yup, it's signed".

And now that I tried to merged it, I noticed my merge commit didn't
get the signage I expected.

And that only happens if I pull a tag that's signed (which also gets
me the message I expect from signed pulls)..

Anyway, now I have both a signature on the merge and on your actual
commit. Thanks,
