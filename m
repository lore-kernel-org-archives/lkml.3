That would be great, given there is a reasonable level of interest from
various parities, and the pain threshold for existing scsi small block
random I/O performance is high..

When will we know if there is a workshop / mini summit slot available..?

FYI, I'm not trying to 'sell' scsi-mq to the larger community yet, but
rather interested in getting the right scsi/block/LLD people in the same
room at KS for an hour or two to discuss implementation details, given
the scope of the effort involved.
