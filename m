the code in this branch does not cover our case, it is intended to cover the case
where __bio_add_page() is called multiple times with the *same* page as parameter.
My patch deals with the case when __bio_add_page() is called with *different* pages
as parameter but physically adjacent to each other.

That said it is true that maybe this branch can be extended to also cover the case
I'm dealing with and try to avoid the problem that commit 3979ef4dcf introduced.

Thanks,
