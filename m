OK - it works without this.  Thanks.

Hmm.  Not sure where I got --static from, but it worked.
But if -static is the norm I'm fine changing to that.

Upon experimentation, I don't need the explicit libgcc or for that
matter the -static-libgcc either.

OK will do.

I'd like to keep base-10 output.  As far as size is concerned, the
code is now at well under 2 pages (8k), which is much smaller than
any actually useful program.  The only noticeable change in size would
be if I got it under 4096, but I don't want to sacrifice too many
features to get there (as that's still only 1 page difference in
memory usage.)

BTW - using sstrip, I can get it to 4096 already, as is.

Unfortunately, 'sstrip -z', which gets it to 2061, makes
it not work.  I need to check out what the problem is there.
Also, the ELF file still has an unneeded note section.  I think
easier reductions, without sacrificing functionality, are available
by tweaking the ELF header (ie fixing sstrip, for those that
want to use it).

I'd prefer to keep the output easily human-readable.

Yes.  Thanks.  Good catch.

OK - look for a new version shortly (maybe not today, though).
