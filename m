This version works as advertised as well.

I think this still leaks the trans structure when an error occurs.
Indeed, I think this is a pre-existing leak, as the current code
will skip freeing the trans structure on item recovery failure and
nothing else frees it.  So it appears to me to be busted before this
patch is added.

Hence on a xlog_recover_items_pass2() error we need to splice the
ra-list to the done_list and free trans. i.e. the "if (error) goto
out;" lines in the above hunk do not need to be there, and the
"out:" label moved to above the call to xlog_recover_free_trans() so
the main loop does the right thing when an error occurs.

Cheers,

Dave.
