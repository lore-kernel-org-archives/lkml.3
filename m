Dropping VM_NONLINEAR would make a lot of stuff so much easier.

I'm fine with dropping this patch again. The mlock and memcg issues
you raised are valid and should get fixed. And indeed, my testing
never triggered any real evelated page-refs except if I pinned them
via FUSE. Therefore, the wait-for-pins function should be sufficient,
indeed.

Thanks for the reviews! I will send v4 shortly.
