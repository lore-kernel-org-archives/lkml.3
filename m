Subject: [PATCH 01/12] procfs: add proc_same_open_cred() to check if the cred have changed

Since /proc entries varies at runtime, permission checks need to
happen during each system call.

However even with that /proc file descriptors can be passed to a more
privileged process (e.g. a suid-exec) which will pass the classic
ptrace_may_access() permission check. The open() call will be issued in
general by an unprivileged process while the disclosure of sensitive
/proc information will happen using a more privileged process at
read(), write()...

The /proc need to know if the cred of the original opener matches the
cred of current in order to take the appropriate actions.

The match concerns the cred fields that are used in the
ptrace_may_access() check: uid, gid and cap_permitted.

If there is a match then the current task that tries to read/write
/proc entries has the same privileges as the task that issued the open()
call.

However if the match fails then the cred have changed which means that
perhaps we have gain or lost the privileges of processing the /proc
file descriptor. So add proc_same_open_cred() to check if the cred have
changed.
