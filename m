If the access to the oom_control file is controlled by the file
permissions then the oom handler can live inside root cgroup. Why do you
need "must be in the same hierarchy" requirement?

Yes, but we are talking about oom handler and that one has to be really
careful about what it does. So doing something that simply allocates is
dangerous.

OK, but both reading tasks file and readdir should be doable without
userspace (aka charged) allocations. Moreover if you run those oom
handlers under the root cgroup then it should be even easier.
