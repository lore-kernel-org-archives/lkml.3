There is no real point.  Even with 4k drives today using 4k sectors in
the filesystem, we still get 512 byte writes because of journalling and
the buffer cache.

The question is what would we need to do to support these devices and
the answer is "try to send IO in x byte multiples x byte aligned" this
really becomes an ioscheduler problem, not a supporting large page
problem.
