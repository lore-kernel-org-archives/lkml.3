Hi Greg,

First of all, I seem to have offended you. That was not my intention.
It's certainly not my intent to disparage you or your work (or for 
that matter, the other kdbus developers). Insofar as any of the wordings 
I've used suggested otherwise, I do apologize.

I'll comment on various points below, keeping it as technical as I can.
Then I have a couple of general questions at the end with the goal
of ensuring that my comments are not coming from a broken world view.

Notwithstanding that I don't see how a unit test stress tests an API 
*design*, I've no reason to doubt that kdbus works. But that's not the 
point of my concern. I worry how usable this API is going to be for the 
world at large.

I didn't expect that you should do that. But it does touch on a general 
question that I'll leave to the end of this mail.

What you've just summarized there is how low a bar we've historically 
set in API design. Thus, the API is littered with (for example) dozens 
of system calls that were insufficiently well thought out in their 
design, and have subsequently been superseded by replacements that 
fixed the design mistakes. One of the cause of that problems is the
targeting of "*a* user of the API"--general purpose APIs need to be
considered from the point of view of multiple potentially different 
use cases. And I'm certainly not talking about being able to reimplement
the API, But, the API is a contract, and it needs to be well understood
by its creators and consumers in order that they can assess and use that
API. Extensive Documentation generally is the best way to do that.

And, anyway, I had understood that there was a rough consensus that we do
want to see more tests/examples and documentation happening in the future.
Certainly, the number kernel developers who are taking a shot at
writing man pages these days is refreshing. (We are 7/7 for man-page
documented system calls in the 3.17-3.19 frame. That's a trend I've done 
my best to encourage, and hope to see continue in the future.) And now
we have kselftest, in part thanks to your good efforts.

You've made this comparison a number of times, but I think it misses
a crucial point. Those examples are all(?) domain-specific APIs with
relatively few users in terms of user-space applications, whereas, 
IIUC, kdbus is intended to be an IPC mechanism that can be employed
by user-space applications in a general-purpose fashion, and upon 
which potentially a multitude of different applications might be built.
That's why I think the decision to use an ioctl()-based interface 
needs to be considered from a (very) skeptical point of view: no other 
general-purpose IPC mechanism employs such an approach. (Again, see
one of my general questions at the end of this mail.)

Yes, but I am not sure that the 15 developers who made each made 1 commit
(out of 2816 to date) would have done much work on the API. And probably 
the same is true for the 9 more who made just 2 or 3 commits. As one
would expect, the great deal of the good work has been done by a small
core: just shy of 95% commits by the top 5 committers.

Greg, I did not say you hadn't been thinking about this [API design].
(But I acknowledge my words could have been better chosen.) However,
API design is hard to get right, and causes endless pain when it's wrong.
And by now I've been watching long enough to know that the mistakes
are frequent. Even Davide Libenzi, who once upon a time was one of our 
more prolific and talented creators of APIs made mistakes. Thus, for
example, as we speak, the third iteration of epoll_wait() is in 
development (epoll_wait() ==> epoll_pwait() ==> epoll_pwait1()). 
And epoll is an API that is significantly simpler than kdbus.

In my observation, a good API design is a well documented API design.
Otherwise, it's virtually impossible to think thoroughly about the API,
and that is especially true as the API gets larger. (And AFAICS, the
kdbus API is bigger than, for example, the epoll API by an order of
magnitude, or so.) Part of that documentation also should include some
concrete examples of the use of the API. Again because it helps people
to think about and assess the API. (This is especially the case for
the fresh minds that explore the new API for the first time without 
having the preconceptions that are almost inevitable for the creators 
of the API.)

(BTW, I'm not ignoring your contents about the D-Bus spec above. But 
kdbus is a free-standing API, IIUC, and as such, it should be assessed 
on its own.)

I would summarize your statement above, as "trust us, we know what 
we're doing". With respect, my default position is not to trust. It's
nothing personal: API design is hard, and mistakes are too often made.
What I want to say in return is "trust us", where "us" is used very
inclusively to mean: the kernel maintainers, and for that matter 
user-space programmers, who need enough information that we can make a
well-informed assessment of the merits of an API that will need to be 
supported forever and may have a multitude of different users. In 
my assessment, the current information is far from sufficient, and 
it's a considerable risk to merge the API lacking such information.

Greg, that comment, with its implication that I am not concerned about
technical matters, but rather with something more malicious was quite 
uncalled for.

But, I am happy to return to technical matters. And I think it best to 
start with a couple of fundamental questions, since some of the comments
I've seen to date from different kdbus developers seem to conflict:

1. Is this intended to be a general purpose API that might see a 
   multitude of different users, or is it thought of as an API designed 
   to support a few specific users such as D-Bus and maybe a handful of 
   others? I had thought the former, but when you point me in the 
   direction of the D-Bus spec, I start to have doubts.

2. Is the API to be invoked directly by applications or is intended to
   be used only behind specific libraries? You seem to be saying that
   the latter is the case (here, I'm referring to your comment above 
   about sd-bus). However, when I asked David Herrmann a similar
   question I got this responser:

      "kdbus is in no way bound to systemd. There are ongoing efforts 
       to port glib and qt to kdbus natively. The API is pretty simple 
       and I don't see how a libkdbus would simplify things. In fact, 
       even our tests only have slim wrappers around the ioctls to 
       simplify error-handling in test-scenarios."

   To me, that implies that users will employ the raw kernel API.

Thanks,

Michael
