Sorry for being slow to join this thread, but I propose the following
patch.  If we can remove support for all CPUs that to not support
direct access to bytes and shorts (which I would very much like to
see happen), I will remove the last non-guarantee.

							Thanx, Paul

documentation: Record limitations of bitfields and small variables

This commit documents the fact that it is not safe to use bitfields
as shared variables in synchronization algorithms.
