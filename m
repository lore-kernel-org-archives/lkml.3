  So the fact that read() or even write() to fd opened O_RDONLY has *any*
effect on f_pos looks really unexpected to me. I think we really should
have there:
	if (ret >= 0)
		file_pos_write(...);
  That would solve problems with read() and write() on directories for
pretty much every filesystem since the first usually returns -EISDIR and
the second -EBADF.

  Yes, and here I'd say it's a filesystem issue. If filesystem needs f_pos
changed only under i_mutex, it should use default_llseek() or get the mutex
itself. That's what the callback is for. We shouldn't unnecessarily impose
the i_mutex restriction on llseek on a directory for every filesystem.
