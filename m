Umm...  What if we delay __sigqueue_free()?  After all, that's where the
fat sucker normally comes from.  That way we might get away with much
smaller structure on stack...

Just introduce a small structure that would contain signr, uid, pid and
pointer to struct sigqueue.  And pass a pointer to _that_ all the way down
to collect_signal().  Pointer's NULL == it's SI_USER with signr/uid/pid
from the small struct and all other fields are zero.  Pointer isn't NULL -
use &small_struct->p->info.  And have struct sigqueue actually freed
via task_work_add() in that case.

Do you see any fundamental problems with that?  Looks like it would be
faster as well - less copying involved...
