I had thought it was when I originally looked at this, but now that I
consider it again I think you may be correct and that there are possible
races here. Since we might end up reblocking behind a different lock
without taking the global spinlock we could flip to blocking behind a
different lock such that a loop is created if you had a complex (>2)
chain of locks.

I think I'm going to have to drop this approach and instead make it so
that the deadlock detection and insertion into the global blocker
list/hash are atomic. Ditto for locks_wake_up_blocks on posix locks and
taking the entries off the list/hash.

Now that I look, I think that approach may actually improve performance
too since we'll be taking the global spinlock less than we would have,
but I'll need to test it out to know for sure.
