Joseph, thanks a lot.

I'll try to read the logs tomorrow, but at first glance Tetsuo was right,
I do not see a "long" sleep in that log. And it shows that the hack around
kthread_run() in scsi_host_alloc() won't help. I am wondering why I didn't
realize this before ;)

Hmm. Perhaps we should simply change mptsas_init() to block all signals
until we have the right fix.

Oleg.
