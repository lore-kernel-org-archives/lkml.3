Hi, Vivek,

Thanks for your careful review. I'll rename t_c to last_dispatch, it's
much better.

For the big burst issue, I've different opinion. Let's discuss it.

Any time a big IO means a big burst. Even if it's throttled at first
time, queued in
the service_queue, and then waited for a while, when it's delivered
out, it IS still
a big burst. So throttling the bio for another while makes no sense.

If a group has been idle for 5 minutes, then it owns the credit to
deliver a big IO
(within 300 * bps bytes). And the extra credit will be cut off after
the delivery.

Waiting for your comments.

Zhiguo
