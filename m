Apologies, I'm not sure what happened.

Looking back at it....  The patch causes all my pynfs reboot recovery
tests to fail.  They're just doing a "systemctl restart
nfs-server.service", and "systemctl status nfs-server.service" shows in
part

	ExecStart=/usr/sbin/rpc.nfsd $RPCNFSDARGS $RPCNFSDCOUNT (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)

So the patch is causing rpc.nfsd to fail?  No network namespaces should
be involved.  

I haven't investigated any further.
