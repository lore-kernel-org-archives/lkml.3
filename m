In that case it might make sense to try the generic approach I suggested 
in the previous mail, which would measure average sleep latencies of 
tasks, and would do light idle-polling instead of the more expensive 
switch-to-the-idle-task context switch plus associated RCU, nohz, etc. 
busy-CPU-tear-down and the symmetric build-up work on idle wakeup.

The IO driver would still have to take an IRQ though, preferably on the 
CPU that runs the IO task ...

Thanks,
