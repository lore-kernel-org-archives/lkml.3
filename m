fadvise is about giving programs the ability to "announce an intention
to access file data in a specific pattern in the future, thus allowing
the kernel to perform appropriate optimizations" according to the
manpage.

Cache invalidation and revalidation, OTOH, is about ensuring meta/data
consistency between the disk and inode/page cache.

I'm not seeing a perfect match. :-)
