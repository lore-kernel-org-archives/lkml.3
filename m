Yeah, I remember. If I remember correctly correctly the pushback was on
a custom event type, right?

Generally speaking I don't mind any solution that we'll get us to the
place both you and I want to be (just being able to time stamp some
performance data in userspace, how difficult can this be! ;-) but I like
the flexibility of an extra sample - one can pick and mix events and
samples at one's leisure.

Yep, that's what I was saying - we can't quite get two timestamps at the
*same*, but getting them within a single atomic block of instructions
gives reasonable accuracy.

Thanks!
