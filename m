 From the term: "feature sets" I'm guessing T10 will follow what T13
does and have something like a VPD page with descriptors of feature
sets supported. Each set has mandatory and optional commands,
perhaps a similar categorization of mode and VPD pages as well. Such
a "clean slate" for SCSI would make it simpler in the future, at
least for what to put on the fast path. Perhaps some legacy
support could be pushed to the user space.

For many technical areas "legacy" is a derogatory term, but
not necessarily for storage!
