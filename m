Yeah, we need.

For the architectures which can do both, for me, they are: sh, powerpc,
m32r, and mips (may mark CPU_LITTLE_ENDIAN), also are: arm/arm64, and
c6x (may mark !CPU_BIG_ENDIAN).

For the architectures which only support little endian: x86, and ia64.

The left, I assumes they are big endian (no any 'ENDIAN' can be found
in their Kconfig files). In my memory, except related with Intel, all
are (or support) big endian.


Thanks.
