The specific use case is to be able to write a filter that allows kill(2)
or tgkill(2) to self, where the filter still works after forking.  Capsicum
capability mode in general locks down system calls that access PIDs
(as they're a global namespace), but allows kill(self) as a pragmatic
compromise to make it easier to migrate applications to use Capsicum.

That sounds like a good idea, as long as it's possible for
non-CAP_SYS_ADMIN processes to do....

For the Capsicum case in particular, most of these are restricted
by the capability mode filter anyhow (although I need to fix it for
CPUCLOCK_PID -- thanks for pointing that out); the kill(2) case
was a special case to make migrations easier.  But a more general
mechanism seems sensible.
