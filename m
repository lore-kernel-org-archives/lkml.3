Yeah, except we access the fields while holding a lock.... wait a
minute.  We're using bit_spinlocks().... and am I missing something?

Where are the barrier statements to prevent the CPU or the compiler
from reordering statements around bit_spin_lock()?  But if that's the
problem, I would have expected lots of other things to be broken.
