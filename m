Hmm.  I hadn't thought of this as a size win, but I guess it could be
if there are static binaries around.

This patch currently generates 488 bytes on text with my toolchain.
More than half of that is garbage needed to deal with the symbol
version tables, and I should be able to move a decent fraction of it
to vdso2c and therefore out of the kernel and vdso images.
