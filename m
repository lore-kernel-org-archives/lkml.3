As you noticed, hitting anon+swap limit just means oom-kill.
My point is that using oom-killer for "server management" just seems crazy.

Let my clarify things. your proposal was.
  1. soft-limit will be a main feature for server management.
  2. Because of soft-limit, global memory reclaim runs.
  3. Using swap at global memory reclaim can cause poor performance.
  4. So, making use of OOM-Killer for avoiding swap.

I can't agree "4". I think

  - don't configure swap.
  - use zram
  - use SSD for swap
Or
  - provide a way to notify usage of "anon+swap" to container management software.

    Now we have "vmpressure". Container management software can kill or respawn container
    with using user-defined policy for avoidng swap.

    If you don't want to run kswapd at all, threshold notifier enhancement may be required.

/proc/meminfo provides total number of ANON/CACHE pages.
Many things can be done in userland.

And your idea can't help swap-out caused by memory pressure comes from "zones".
I guess vmpressure will be a total win. The kernel may need some enhancement
but I don't like to make use of oom-killer as a part of feature for avoiding swap.
