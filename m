Subject: [PATCH 4/6] cgroup: implement cgroup_subsys->css_reset()

cgroup is implementing support for subsystem dependency which would
require a way to enable a subsystem even when it's not directly
configured through "cgroup.subtree_control".

The previous patches added support for explicitly and implicitly
enabled subsystems and showing/hiding their interface files.  An
explicitly enabled subsystem may become implicitly enabled if it's
turned off through "cgroup.subtree_control" but there are subsystems
depending on it.  In such cases, the subsystem, as it's turned off
when seen from userland, shouldn't enforce any resource control.
Also, the subsystem may be explicitly turned on later again and its
interface files should be as close to the intial state as possible.

This patch adds cgroup_subsys->css_reset() which is invoked when a css
is hidden.  The callback should disable resource control and reset the
state to the vanilla state.

+An optional operation which should restore @css's configuration to the

+when a subsystem is disabled on a cgroup through
+"cgroup.subtree_control" but should remain enabled because other
+subsystems depend on it.  cgroup core makes such a css invisible by
+removing the associated interface files and invokes this callback so
+that the hidden subsystem can return to the initial neutral state.
+This prevents unexpected resource control from a hidden css and
+ensures that the configuration is in the initial state when it is made
+visible again later.
