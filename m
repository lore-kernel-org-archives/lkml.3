After playing a bit with the interface, I think it falls short supporting 
AF_ALG in the following way:

crypto_user cannot be applied to the currently active cipher that one has open 
with AF_ALG. For getting information, one has to call crypto_user with the 
cra_driver_name of a cipher. (Why is that limitation, btw (see crypto_report 
and the use of cru_driver_name?)

When we open AF_ALG with the typical approach of simply a cra_name, you have 
no idea which cipher is selected. User space has no way to obtain the 
information on which particular cipher implementation is used with 
crypto_user.

That means, to use crypto_user, we would first have to translate a cra_name 
into a cra_driver_name. Granted, any cra_driver_name for the given cra_name 
would work. But how would such a resolution be implemented? The only way would 
be via /proc/crypto. But that file does not contain all cipher / block 
chaining permutations. For example, ccm(aes) is not listed in /proc/crypto at 
all (even after using it via the kernel crypto API -- i.e. there is an 
accessible ccm(aes) implementation). Therefore, there is no way to resolve 
ccm(aes) to a cra_driver_name. 

Btw: is there an example that uses that interface? The ordering of data 
structures in the netlink message is not really clear from looking at the 
code.
