OK, what you said sounds reasonable to me. After search "endian" in
"./arch", xtensa also can be support both big endian or little endian.

Yeah, but that may break building and re-config manually. So it is still
necessary to check little endian or big endian during configuration time
("make *config").


Thanks.
