  I've just now checked how e.g. hlist iterators solve similar problem and
modified the rbtree iterator accordingly. The patch is attached and with it
and your ext3 patch my test machine is able to boot again.

Subject: [PATCH] rbtree: Fix rbtree_postorder_for_each_entry_safe() iterator

The iterator rbtree_postorder_for_each_entry_safe() relies on pointer
underflow behavior when testing for loop termination. In particular
it expects that
  &rb_entry(NULL, type, field)->field
is NULL. But the result of this expression is not defined by a C standard
and some gcc versions (e.g. 4.3.4) assume the above expression can never
be equal to NULL. The net result is an oops because the iteration is not
properly terminated.

Fix the problem by modifying the iterator to avoid pointer underflows.
