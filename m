Hello, Linus.

A lot of activities on the cgroup front.  Most changes aren't visible
to userland at all at this point and are laying foundation for the
planned unified hierarchy.

* The biggest change is decoupling the lifetime management of css
  (cgroup_subsys_state) from that of cgroup's.  Because controllers
  (cpu, memory, block and so on) will need to be dynamically enabled
  and disabled, css which is the association point between a cgroup
  and a controller may come and go dynamically across the lifetime of
  a cgroup.  Till now, css's were created when the associated cgroup
  was created and stayed till the cgroup got destroyed.

  Assumptions around this tight coupling permeated through cgroup core
  and controllers.  These assumptions are gradually removed, which
  consists bulk of patches, and css destruction path is completely
  decoupled from cgroup destruction path.  Note that decoupling of
  creation path is relatively easy on top of these changes and the
  patchset is pending for the next window.

* cgroup has its own event mechanism cgroup.event_control, which is
  only used by memcg.  It is overly complex trying to achieve high
  flexibility whose benefits seem dubious at best.  Going forward, new
  events will simply generate file modified event and the existing
  mechanism is being made specific to memcg.  This pull request
  contains prepatory patches for such change.

* Various fixes and cleanups.

Merging into master 2f01ea908b ("Merge tag 'tty-3.12-rc1' of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/tty") generates
one conflict in kernel/cgroup.c.

	/*
<<<<<<< HEAD
	 * Make sure there's no live children.  We can't test ->children
	 * emptiness as dead children linger on it while being destroyed;
	 * otherwise, "rmdir parent/child parent" may fail with -EBUSY.
	 */
	empty = true;
	rcu_read_lock();
	list_for_each_entry_rcu(child, &cgrp->children, sibling) {
		empty = cgroup_is_dead(child);
		if (!empty)
			break;
	}
	rcu_read_unlock();
	if (!empty)
		return -EBUSY;

	/*

	 */
	for_each_root_subsys(cgrp->root, ss)
		kill_css(cgroup_css(cgrp, ss));

This is the last minute fix bb78a92f47 ("cgroup: fix rmdir EBUSY
regression in 3.11") which was merged after v3.11-rc7 conflicting with
updates in for-3.12 and can be resolved by taking only the emptiness
check part from master.

Just in case, the following branch has an example merge.

  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tj/cgroup.git test-merge-3.12

I pulled for-3.11-fixes into for-3.12 once during the last devel cycle
and git-request-pull got confused when generating diffstat, so I
generated it manually by diffing master against test-merge-3.12.

Thanks.
