Agreed, but notice that you'll want to be careful to update
write_buf()'s *off because passing a dereferenced copy to kernel_write()
will lose the pos update that vfs_write() is currently taking care of.

A carefully placed "*off += ret" in write_buf() will be fine.  (As fine
as having a magical private file position in the send context ever was.)

Yeah, I don't think that overhead is going to be significant given all
of the work that's going on.

I disagree.  I wouldn't broaden the scope to add retrying on behalf of
all kernel_write() callers and write methods (it's exported to modules,
too).  I'd leave the looping in btrfs and just call kernel_write() to
get rid of the segment juggling.
