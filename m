Hey Guys ,
I am new to   reading  and writing  kernel code.I got interested in
writing code for btrfs as it seems to
need more work then other file systems and this seems other then
drivers, a good use of time on my part.
I interested in helping improving the compression of btrfs by using  a
set of threads using work queues like XFS
or reads and keeping the page cache after reading compressed blocks as
these seem to be a great way to improve
on  compression performance mostly with large partitions of compressed
data. I am not asking you to write the code
for me but as I am new a little guidance and help would be greatly
appreciated as this seems like too much work for just a newbie.
Thanks A lot,
Nick
