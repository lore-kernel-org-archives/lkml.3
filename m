So how do you achieve it? IOW, how do you figure out something is
interactive and just give it priority and almost stop other. What happens
to notion of fairness in that case.

And if there is a way to figure out interactive applications, then even
in CFQ, one should be able to easily put these queues in the beginning of
service tree so that they get served first and achieve better experience?

And in general that would be a desirable thing to do. So why not modify
CFQ.

Again, how do you achieve it?

For what workload?

Is this true with buffered write workload also? I think these % will
be very dependent on IO pattern.

Again I would like to know how did you achieve such a high throughput
when compared to CFQ, Deadline, NOOP. One of the things which drops
throughput on rotational hard disk is non-sequential IO pattern and
CFQ already does that. So only way to achieve higher throughput will
be to accumulate more sequetial IO in the queue and then let that queue
run for longer and stop other IO from other queues. And that will mean
higher latencies for IO in other queues.

So on this rotation hard disk, how do you achieve higher throughput as
well as reduced latency.

I think this is one key differece as comapred to CFQ. Fairness based
on bandwidth and not fairness based on time slice.

So if a process is doing large sequential IO and other is doing small
random IO, most of the disk time will be given to process doing small
random IOs. Is that more fair. I think that's one reason that CFQ was
switched to time based scheme. Provide time slices and after that
it is up to the application how much they can get out of disk in that
slice based on their IO pattern. At least in terms of fairness, that
sounds more fair to me.

I think this is one point which needs to be discussed that is it
a better idea to switch to bandwidth based fairness. Should we change
CFQ to achieve that or we need to introduce new IO scheduler for that.

This is very hard to understand. This puzzle need to be broken down
into small pieces and explained in simple design terms so that even
5 years down the line I can explain why BFQ was better.
