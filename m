Subject: [PATCH 4/8] cgroup: move cgroup->kn->priv clearing to cgroup_rmdir()
Date: Tue,  6 May 2014 16:19:30 -0400
Message-Id: <1399407574-21472-5-git-send-email-tj@kernel.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 1.9.0
In-Reply-To: <1399407574-21472-1-git-send-email-tj@kernel.org>

The ->priv field of a cgroup directory kernfs_node points back to the
cgroup.  This field is RCU cleared in cgroup_destroy_locked() for
non-kernfs accesses from css_tryget_from_dir() and
cgroupstats_build().

As these are only applicable to cgroups which finished creation
successfully and fully initialized cgroups are always removed by
cgroup_rmdir(), this can be safely moved to the end of cgroup_rmdir().

This will help simplifying cgroup locking and shouldn't introduce any
behavior difference.
