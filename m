Hi Tejun,

This email worries me.  A lot.  It sounds very much like retrograde
motion from our (Google's) point of view.

We absolutely depend on the ability to split cgroup hierarchies.  It
pretty much saved our fleet from imploding, in a way that a unified
hierarchy just could not do.  A mandated unified hierarchy is madness.
 Please step away from the ledge.

More, going towards a unified hierarchy really limits what we can
delegate, and that is the word of the day.  We've got a central
authority agent running which manages cgroups, and we want out of this
business.  At least, we want to be able to grant users a set of
constraints, and then let them run wild within those constraints.
Forcing all such work to go through a daemon has proven to be very
problematic, and it has been great now that users can have DIY
sub-cgroups.

This!  A thousand times, this!

We've been bitten by this, and more limitations would be great.  We've
got some less-than-perfect patches that impose limits for us now.

Strong disagreement, here.  We use split hierarchies to great effect.
Containment should be composable.  If your users or abstractions can't
handle it, please feel free to co-mount the universe, but please
PLEASE don't force us to.

I'm happy to talk more about what we do and why.
