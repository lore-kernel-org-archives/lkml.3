Yes and no.  I still end up with an empty /etc/mtab, but the file now
exists.  However, I can create and echo data into /etc/mtab, but it seems
that can't happen at boot time.

I also find that kerberos doesn't work - again, it's weird - I can create
the file which kerberos is trying to create in /var/tmp (which is also on
the root nfs) manually, but when the kerberos daemons try to create it,
it fails with -EOPNOTSUPP.  The kerberos daemon is running as uid 0 at
that point (I don't know about the other uids/gids though since I wasn't
able to catch them in the strace.)

in database were 13.1 to 19Mbit for a good line, about 7.5+ for a bad.
Estimate before purchase was "up to 13.2Mbit".
