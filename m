Cool, thanks for sending this out.  I'll just stare blankly but
supportively at the SCSI details.

I've been experimenting with the reasonable suggestion of using splice
as the entry point into the high level fs methods that'd be backed by
this stuff.  Let me get it cleaned up and sent out for review.

Hopefully with a few iterations of that we could test some block file
systems on top of this.

That's exciting!  I doubt that we want to be derailed by getting this
working in the first pass, but it'd be fun to enable cross-fs copying
once we got the fundamentals worked out
