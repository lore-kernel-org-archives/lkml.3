Thanks, I'll take a look at these patches.  Honestly, I've been half
tempted to remove the e2fsck -c option entirely.  99.9% of the time,
with modern disks, which has bad block remapping, it doesn't do any
good, and often, it's harmful.

In general, e2fsck -c is not something I recommend people use.  If you
want to use badblocks by itself to see if there are any blocks that
are suffering read problems, that's fine, but if there is, in general
the safest thing to do is to mount the disk read-only, back it up, and
then either (a) reformat and see if you can restore onto it with
backups w/o any further errors, or (b) just trash the disk, and get a
new one, since in general the contents are way more valuable than the
disk itself.  Certainly after trying (a), you get any further errors,
(b) is defintely the way to go.
