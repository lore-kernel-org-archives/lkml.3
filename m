Namjae, what's your proposed timeframe on getting the xfs_io and tes
cases sorted out? I'm just trying to plan ahead for the next couple
of months (i.e. the 3.16 merge cycle), so some indication of whether
I can expect this to be complete and ready for merge within that
timeframe would be helpful to me.

FWIW, it would be really nice if you could add support for fsx and
fsstress for this as well as adding corner case tests. :)

Cheers,

Dave.
