I prefer to allocate dynamically here. But although I understand why we
need to call cgroup_name, I don't understand what is wrong with
kasprintf if we're going to allocate anyway. It will allocate a string
just big enough. A PAGE_SIZE'd allocation is a lot more likely to fail.

Now, if we really want to be smart here, we can do something like what
I've done for the slub attribute buffers, that can actually have very
long values.

allocate a small buffer that will hold 80 % > of the allocations (256
bytes should be enough for most cache names), and if the string is
bigger than this, we allocate. Once we allocate, we save it in a static
pointer and leave it there. The hope here is that we may be able to
live without ever allocating in many systems.

The comment is also no longer true if you don't resort to a static buffer.

The following (untested) patch implements the idea I outlined above.

What do you guys think ?

Subject: [PATCH] memcg: fix memcg_cache_name() to use cgroup_name()

As cgroup supports rename, it's unsafe to dereference dentry->d_name
without proper vfs locks. Fix this by using cgroup_name() rather than
dentry directly.

This patch also takes the opportunity to be smarter about string
allocation. Most strings related to cache names will be relatively
small, including with the addition of the memcg suffix. Therefore
we try our best to use a buffer that may hold all allocations. If
we can't, we allocate a page. And leave it there for the rest of
the life of the system. While this is slightly more code-complex,
it makes us run less into the risk of failed allocations, which
is always a good thing.
