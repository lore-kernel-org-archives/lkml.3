It fixes some unused variable warnings introduced by NFS FS-Cache patches that
I have (a variable is set up and only passed to dfprintk() a couple of times).

I could change those patches to do something different, but I think changing
dfprintk() is actually the right solution as it will catch errors introduced
into dfprintk() calls that are currently reduced to do{}while(0) by the
preprocessor rather than letting the compiler chew on them and then reducing
them to nothing with the optimiser.
