Right now user namespace + audit is just total crud.  We all know
this...  (I'm not sure pid is must better, but I digress)   All thoughts
around loginuid in the kernel right this very moment only make sense in
the initial user namespace and all permission checks are in the initial
user namespace as well.

I think I'm a proponent of the hierarchical approach to audit
namespaces.  An audit namespace would hold a reference to the
pid/user/whatever namespace it was created in/with.  Each audit
namespace should have it's own set of filter rules, etc.  Instead of
just storing 'loginuid' we store 'loginuid+user namespace'.   When the
kernel creates a record it should translate the loginuid to the
namespace of the audit namespace and send the record.

It's a pretty major rewrite, but at least it makes sense.  Things like
AVC's might show up in multiple audit logs, but in every log they would
make sense to the admin of that namespace...

But what the hell do I know...  Namespaces scare me...
