This is true for ext4 as well.  Block size == page size support is
pretty easy; the hard part is when block size > page size, due to
assumptions in the VM layer that requires that FS system needs to do a
lot of extra work to fudge around.  So the real problem comes with
trying to support 64k block sizes on a 4k page architecture, and can
we do it in a way where every single file system doesn't have to do
their own specific hacks to work around assumptions made in the VM
layer.

Some of the problems include handling the case where you get someone
dirties a single block in a sparse page, and the FS needs to manually
fault in the other 56k pages around that single page.  Or the VM not
understanding that page eviction needs to be done in chunks of 64k so
we don't have part of the block evicted but not all of it, etc.
