This whole code path is so complicated by different types of delayed
work that I am not wondering that we have missed that :/

That is basically what I was suggesting
http://marc.info/?l=linux-mm&m=139178386407184&w=2 as #1 option. I
cannot say I would like it and I think that reparenting LRUs in
css_offline and then reparent the remaining charges from css_free is a
better solution but let's keep this for later.

OK, I guess we should go with this one because it describes both the
problem in memcg offlining and requirements from the cgroup core so the
later approach can build on top of it.

I plan to implement the LRU care for css_offline and charge drain for
css_free later on but I have quite some work on my plate currently so I
cannot promis it will be done right now. I hope to have it soon though.
