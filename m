In the above, are you introducing UNLOCK + LOCK not being a full barrier
or are you further elaborating the non-barrier that is LOCK + UNLOCK.

If you mean the first, might I suggest something like,

"Similarly, a RELEASE followed by an ACQUIRE may -not- be assumed to be a full
memory barrier."

as the introductory sentence.

Thanks for your work on these docs (and rcu and locks and multi-arch barriers
in general :) )
