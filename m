I've submitted a report with patch
(http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=719774)

Ohh, I have totally missed those left-overs. I would rather fix the doc
than reintroduce the handling without any value.

Subject: [PATCH] memcg: get rid of swapaccount leftovers

swapaccount kernel parameter without any values has been removed by
a2c8990a (memsw: remove noswapaccount kernel parameter) but it seems
that we didn't get rid of all the left overs.

Make sure that menuconfig help text and kernel-parameters.txt are clear
about value for the paramter and remove the stalled comment which is not
very much useful on its own.
