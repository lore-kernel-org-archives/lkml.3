To your first question, perhaps it could not be. In
the scsi_debug driver almost all uses of 'devip'
check for NULL, so it may not always have been true.

'rmmod scsi_debug' would lead to scsi_debug_exit()
being called and that called stop_all_queued() which
deadlocked with a command completion, or worse command
commencement. scsi_debug_exit() looks a bit racy: the
first thing it does is stop_all_queued() but has
anything been done to stop new commands being issued?
Later scsi_debug_exit() brings down the hosts.


This patch is primarily a bug fix for the lk 3.17 series and
the code you highlight was simply moved from being under a
lock to outside that lock. I didn't want to be too creative,
it's too easy to slip up and upset the management.


Enhancements could be sent to your drivers-for-3.18 tree. Rob
Elliott already has a few in mind, to improve performance.
Removing all 'devip' NULL checks would also improve performance,
and readability.
