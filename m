Here's how I read the two statements.

First, the commit message:

"It [this commit] documents that CPUs [supported by the Linux kernel]
_must provide_ atomic one-byte and two-byte naturally aligned loads and stores."

Second, in the body of the document:

"The Linux kernel no longer supports pre-EV56 Alpha CPUs, because these
older CPUs _do not provide_ atomic one-byte and two-byte loads and stores."
