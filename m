I don't know if its a good idea to require an initramfs for mounting a
rootfs over the network. NFS root is currently in the kernel, and
frequently used without an initramfs.

Booting from ceph using a root device is relatively simple compared to
generating an initramfs and it has the possibility of producing smaller
images for memory constrained devices.
