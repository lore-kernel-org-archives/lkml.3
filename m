Ok, potential race here. We hold the i_lock when we check list_empty()
above, but it's possible for the fl_block list to become empty between
that check and when we take the spinlock below. locks_delete_block does
not require that you hold the i_lock, and some callers don't hold it.

This is trivially fixable by just keeping this as a while() loop. We'll
do the list_empty() check twice in that case, but that shouldn't change
the performance here much.

I'll fix that in my tree and it'll be in the next resend. Sorry for the
noise...
