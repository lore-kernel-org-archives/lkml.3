I'd like to see a more ambitious change, since the timer isn't the
only problem like this.  Specifically, I'd like a syscall that does a
list of epoll-related things and then waits.  The list of things could
include, at least:

 - EPOLL_CTL_MOD actions: level-triggered epoll users are likely to
want to turn on and off their requests for events on a somewhat
regular basis.

 - timerfd_settime actions: this allows a single syscall to wait and
adjust *both* monotonic and real-time wakeups.

Would this make sense?  It could look like:

int epoll_mod_and_pwait(int epfd,
  struct epoll_event *events, int maxevents,
  struct epoll_command *commands, int ncommands,
  const sigset_t *sigmask);
