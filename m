Ok, thanks for checking.

That's preferrable, the overhead should be small.

Snapshotting of NODATACOW files work, the extents are COWed on the first
write, the original owner sees no change.

So we should make sure that any write to the swapfile will not lead to
the first-COW, this would require to scan all the extents and see if
we're the owner and COW eventually.

Doing that automatically is IMO better from the user perspective,
compared to an erroring out and requesting a manual "dd" over the file.

Possibly, the implied COW could create preallocated extents so we do not
have to rewrite the data.

Easy to implement but could lead to bad suprises.

More thoughts:

There are some guards in the generic code to prevent unwanted
modifications to the swapfiles (eg. no truncate, no fallocate, no
deletion). Further we should audit btrfs ioctls that may interfere with
swap and forbid any action (notably the cloning and deduplication ones).
