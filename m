They do when they call eventfd_ctx_remove_wait_queue.  The irqfd is
enabled until that point and the list_del_init prevents multiple paths
from calling irqfd_deactivate.

Note that this is not kvm->irqfds.items, we're testing whether the
individual irqfd is detached from the list.

It cannot be kfreed.  As noted above the cpu0 path stops trying to
acquire wqh->lock which already owned by cpu1.  The call to
eventfd_ctx_remove_wait_queue atomically removes the wait queue once the
wqh->lock is acquired, so after that point we're ok to kfree it.
