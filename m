Hm, I just noticed:

    commit 0d0d110720d7960b77c03c9f2597faaff4b484ae

    GFS2: d_splice_alias() can't return error
    
    unless it was given an IS_ERR(inode), which isn't the case here.  So clean
    up the unnecessary error handling in gfs2_create_inode().
    
    This paves the way for real fixes (hence the stable Cc).

While the statement is true for the current implementation of
d_splice_alias, I don't think it's actually true for any correct
implementation of d_splice_alias, which must be able to return at least
-ELOOP in the directory case.  Does gfs2 need fixing?

--b.
