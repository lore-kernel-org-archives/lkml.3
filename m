I don't see how this _has_ to exist for any of the userspace tools.
If the file is corrupt (i.e. cannot be decompressed), then that is
no different than if the file is corrupt and it is a regular file.
e2fsck doesn't detect file content corruption, and AFAIK neither
does xfs_repair.  Why is the bar raised just because there is a
flag that reports the file is in compressed format?

I'm not saying that a tool to check this would be a bad thing, but
if the compression support is a generic feature of the VFS, then it
makes sense that the checker can also be generic and unrelated to
the filesystem metadata checking as well.  It may be "gunzip -t"
or LZO equivalent is enough to determine if the file is/isn't in a
valid state, and if not then the flag can be cleared from userspace
in the same way it was set (presumably chattr is enough).

Possibly a per-file hook could be added to the fsck tools to run an
arbitrary data verification command?  That would be generically
useful for all kinds of things and not just this compression code.

Presumably if the userspace checking is independent of the fsck tool
this would be much less of a burden.  As you write below, we'd also
want to avoid flavour-of-the-month for compression formats, to keep
the ongoing burden down.

The testing is definitely needed in order for this to become robust.
I'm not sure if any of this is filesystem-specific.  It might even
be possible to change things minimally to generate all files in
compressed mode when running some other test (e.g. LD_PRELOAD hook
on close() that compresses the file and sets the flag if it isn't
already set)?

Sure, but it all has to start somewhere...

Definitely agree with this part.
