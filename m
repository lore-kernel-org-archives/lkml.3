Ok.

First, because the table is based on
http://www.t10.org/lists/op-num.txt. Entries in that file look like this:

OP  DTLPWROMAEBKVF  Description
--  --------------  ----------------------------------------------------
00  MMMMMMMMMMMMMM  TEST UNIT READY
01   M              REWIND
01  Z V ZZZZ        REZERO UNIT

which explains a bit the formatting.

Second, because many symbolic constants do not exist in
include/scsi/scsi.h or include/linux/uapi/cdrom.h, and I don't think it
would make sense to add them for a one-off use, especially for obsolete
commands or device types.

No, it's not that.  In fact using the symbolic constants would save a
few characters (for the 0xNN and the comment start).  I really prefer to
keep the opcode visible so that you can easily match the code to op-num.txt.

ALL instead of -1 is a good idea, or I can just spell it out if it's
okay for you.

// is nicer in my opinion (for this case where we're throwing away all
the rules anyway) because it avoids the misaligned */ but I can change
it of course.

It is actually more cacheline friendly like this.  The vast majority of
commands will be READ and WRITE, which are 0x?8 and 0x?A.  So in
practice one cacheline will be shared by all device types, maybe two if
you use READ/WRITE(12) for some devices and READ/WRITE(16) for others.

Yeah, that's what happens because GCC will inline
blk_set_cmd_filter_defaults into its sole caller which is __init.
There's no difference from before this patch, but I can add an explicit
__init to blk_set_cmd_filter_defaults too.

This patch ties to keep the list as similar as possible to the old one,
to ease review.  There is usually a 1:1 matching between "old" and "new"
lines, and this limits the freedom I have in organizing the list.

In the next patches I gradually move towards a more structured
organization, usually something like standard->command (one standard may
correspond to more than one device type, but all of them are described
in the same document).
