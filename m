What the hell are you talking about?  Nobody is breaking userland
interface.  A new version of interface is being phased in and the old
one will stay there for the foreseeable future.  It will be phased out
eventually but that's gonna take a long time and it will have to be
something hardly noticeable.  Of course new features will only be
available with the new interface and there will be efforts to nudge
people away from the old one but the existing interface will keep
working it does.

Then the security gang doesn't have any clue what's going on, or at
least operating on very different assumptions (ie. the workloads are
trusted by default).  You can OOM the whole kernel by creating many
cgroups, completely mess up controllers by creating deep hierarchies,
affect your siblings by adjusting your weight and so on.  It's really
easy to DoS the whole system if you have write access to a cgroup
directory.

Why is that tho?  It *should* work fine and I can't think of a reason
why that would behave particularly badly off the top of my head.
Maybe I forgot too much of the iosched modification used in google.
Anyways, if there's a problem, that should be fixable, right?  And
controller-specific issues like that should really dictate the
architectural design too much.

Yeah, that is horrible.

But I don't follow the conclusion here.  For short term workaround,
sure, but having that dictate the whole architecture decision seems
completely backwards to me.

If so, you aren't communicating it very well.  I've talked with quite
a few people about multiple orthogonal hierarchies including people
inside google.  Sure, some are using it as it is there but I couldn't
find strong enough rationale to continue that way given the amount of
crazys it implies / encourages.  On the other hand, most people agreed
that having a unified hierarchy with differing level of granularities
would serve their cases well enough while not being crazy.

Really, I have $huge_number of machines configured certain way isn't
much of an argument when unified hierarchy isn't gonna break them and
many people involved in cgroup both on kernel and userland sides share
the view that the whole thing is a hellish mess which can only be used
by crafting very specialized configurations for each setup.

That's about google's blkcg modifications to support blkcg on
writeback IOs.  It works but can't be upstreamed as it requires
tagging each page both with memcg and blkcg tags.

Now I'm lost what you're talking about.  But the summary is, in the
future, use a single unified hierarchy with differing granularities.
It's still being worked on, so, for now, try not to depend on creating
completely orthogonal hierarchies for different controllers.

What time frame are you referring to?

How the hell am I gonna screw you in a year and half?  What are you
talking about?  Where is this coming from?

I frankly have no idea what you're talking about.  Calm down and try
to understand what's actually going on.

Thanks.
