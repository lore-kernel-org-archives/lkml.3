Hi all,

When I debug the file system, I get a problem as follows:

Arch: arm (4 processors)
Kernel version: 3.3.0

   The "b_frozen_data" which is defined as a member of "struct
journal_head" (linux/fs/jbd2/transaction.c Line 785),
it's memory is allocated by "jbd2_alloc". When the memory size is
larger than a PAGE SIZE, the memory is got by "
__get_free_pages", otherwise, is got by "kmem_cache_alloc". The
memory will be used by the "__blk_queue_bounce"(linux/mm/bounce.c).

In this function, the program flow is:
__blk_queue_bounce() -> flush_dcache_page() -> page_mapping() ->
VM_BUG_ON(PageSlab(page))
If the memory is got by "kmem_cache_alloc", it will trigger on a bug.

Kernel panic:

So, I modify the mm/bounce.c. Details are as follows:

                          memcpy(vto, vfrom, to->bv_len);

Who can give some suggestions to me.

Thanks
