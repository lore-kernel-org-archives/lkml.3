The new mechanism is only for the unified hierarchy.  The old one will
be kept around for other hierarchies.

I don't think so.  Implementing such simplistic mechanism in userland
is trivial and even independent failover mechanisms can be easily
implemented from userland as multiple entities can set up watches.  I
don't think there's much value in providing another mechanism from
kernel side.  The only reason why release_agent thing got as complex
as it is is because the mechanism is fundamentally flawed - clumsy
delivery, no multiple watches, single watch point - so people tried to
work around it by adding event filtering from kernel side, which is
quite backwards IMHO.  With proper event mechanism, everything should
be easily achievable from userland side.

The case where you move a task out of x1/y1 to another cgroup doesn't
generate an event.  One could say that that's unnecessary because the
mover knows that the cgroup is becoming empty; however, it excludes
any cases where there are more than one actors and the same can be
said for cases when the actor is removing a child.

Oops, yeap.  Will update.

Thanks!
