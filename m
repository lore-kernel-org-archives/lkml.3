So does the code:

+ /*
+ * The first receiver which requests additional
+ * metadata causes the message to carry it; all
+ * receivers after that will see all of the added
+ * data, even when they did not ask for it.
+ */
+ if (conn_src) {
+ /* Check if conn_src is allowed to signal */
+ ret = kdbus_ep_policy_check_broadcast(conn_dst->ep,
+ conn_src,
+ conn_dst);
+ if (ret < 0)
+ continue;
+
+ ret = kdbus_ep_policy_check_src_names(conn_dst->ep,
+ conn_src,
+ conn_dst);
+ if (ret < 0)
+ continue;
+
+ ret = kdbus_kmsg_attach_metadata(kmsg, conn_src,
+ conn_dst);
+ if (ret < 0)
+ goto exit_unlock;
+ }
+

I'd like this if the sender chose the metadata flags.  In fact, I'd
want to make that feature available on regular UNIX sockets, too
(search the archives for SCM_IDENTITY).
