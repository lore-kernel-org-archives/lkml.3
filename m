Correction: that comment suggests that it was intentionally done. I
didn't write the comment and I make no judgement on whether it makes
sense or not (it looks like it would *normally* make sense, but I guess
nobody thought of the case of a connection being done as part of
disconnection after the cwd is gone).

I'm just the guy getting bitten by the resulting oops :)
