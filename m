Eh?   We have iov[0].iov_base..iov[0].iov_base+iov[0].iov_len - 1 for
area covered by the first iovec.  First iov_offset bytes have already
been consumed.  And at most count bytes matter.  So yes, this iov_len
will give you equivalent first iovec.

Said that, iov_iter_iovec() will die shortly - it's a rudiment of older
code, with almost no users left.  But yes, it is correct.

It is, and your patch is a huge overkill.

No, it does not.  It's specifically about iov_iter_truncate(); moreover,
it matters to only one caller of that sucker.  Namely,

static ssize_t blkdev_read_iter(struct kiocb *iocb, struct iov_iter *to)
{
        struct file *file = iocb->ki_filp;
        struct inode *bd_inode = file->f_mapping->host;
        loff_t size = i_size_read(bd_inode);
        loff_t pos = iocb->ki_pos;

        if (pos >= size)
                return 0;

        size -= pos;
        iov_iter_truncate(to, size);
        return generic_file_read_iter(iocb, to);
}

What happens here is capping to->count, to guarantee that we won't even look
at anything past the end of block device.  Alternative fix would be to
have
	if (pos >= size)
		return 0;
	if (to->size + pos > size) {
		/* note that size - pos fits into size_t in this case,
		 * so it's OK to pass it to iov_iter_truncate().
		 */
		iov_iter_truncate(to, size - pos);
	}
        return generic_file_read_iter(iocb, to);
in there.  Other callers are passing it size_t values already, so we don't
need similar checks there.

Or we can make iov_iter_truncate() take an arbitrary u64 argument, seeing that
it's inlined anyway.  IMO it's more robust that way...

Anyway, does the following alone fix the problem you are seeing?
