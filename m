I think that you are wrong here James. Even with 512 byte drives, the IO's we 
send down tend to be 4k or larger. Do you have traces that show this and details?

Not that simple.

The requirement of some of these devices are that you *never* send down a 
partial write or an unaligned write.

Also keep in mind that larger block sizes allow us to track larger files with 
smaller amounts of metadata which is a second win.
