  ext3 (similarly as ext4) does block level journalling meaning that it
journals *only* full blocks. So an ext3/4 filesystem with 4 KB blocksize
will never journal anything else than full 4 KB blocks. So I'm not sure
where this 512-byte writes idea came from..

  I also believe drives will support smaller-than-blocksize writes. But
supporting larger fs blocksize can sometimes be beneficial for other
reasons (think performance with specialized workloads because amount of
metadata is smaller, fragmentation is smaller, ...). Currently ocfs2, ext4,
and possibly others go through the hoops to support allocating file data in
chunks larger than fs blocksize - at the first sight that should be
straightforward but if you look at the code you find out there are nasty
corner cases which make it pretty ugly. And each fs doing these large data
allocations currently invents its own way to deal with the problems. So
providing some common infrastructure for dealing with blocks larger than
page size would definitely relieve some pain.
