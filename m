>From: Roland Eggner <edvx1@systemanalysen.net>

=E2=80=A2  Implemented vi-style navigation <k> <j> <l> <h>, based on initia=
l work by
   Dmitry Voytik.  Using <?> <H> instead of <?> <h> for help related to cur=
rent
   menu entry avoids conflict.

=E2=80=A2  Added keybindings <C-n> <C-p> additionally to <C-f> <C-b> for mo=
ving pagewise
   down and up.  <C-f> <C-b> is used for characterwise right and left movem=
ent
   by libreadline (bash, xfsprogs, bc, gdb, python, ruby, hunspell, mysql,
   sqlite, gnupg, xine-ui, parted =E2=80=A6).  Thus pagewise movement by <C=
-n> <C-p> is
   less confusing than by <C-f> <C-b> for my fingers.

=E2=80=A2  Rewrote all help texts.  During several years lazy (incomplete) =
updates had
   left behind a rather thick layer of dust.  Intentions:
   (1)  Global help called by <F1> should document all  _currently_  implem=
ented
        keybindings.
   (2)  Different help texts called by <F3> resp. <F8><F1> should be consis=
tent
        with (1) and with implementation:
        =E2=80=A2  on plain menu entry
        =E2=80=A2  in radiolist window
        =E2=80=A2  in input windows for text, decimal or hexadecimal values
        =E2=80=A2  in filename selection windows <F6> <F7>
        =E2=80=A2  SymSearch specific help called by <F8> followed by <F1>

=E2=80=A2  Function keys line:  =E2=80=9CHelp 2=E2=80=9D instead of =E2=80=
=9CInsts=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9CShowAll=E2=80=9D instead of
   =E2=80=9CConfig=E2=80=9D should be more intuitiv.
