  Thanks. So I had a look and the difference is in ext4 block reservation
logic. ext4 stores away some blocks as reserved so that it can use them
as a safety pool in case it really needs to finish some metadata operations
and there isn't enough free space (see commit
27dd43854227bb0e6ab70129bd21b60d396db2e7 for detailed description).

However this block reservation isn't really needed when fs doesn't support
extents. So I'll send a patch in a moment which fixes the problem for me.
