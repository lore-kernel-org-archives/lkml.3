No no, I'm not talking about it not working for the users - it's just
passing the commands, it of course works.  I'm doubting about it being
a worthy security isolation layer.  cdb filtering (of any form really)
has always been something on the border.  It always was something we
got stuck with due to lack of other immediate options.

I'm wondering whether combining 3 into 4 would be good enough.

Hmmm?  Somebody has to give out the access rights anyway, be it a udev
rule or polkit.  While not having to depend on them could be nice, I
don't think involving userland is a big deal.  It's already involved
in closely related capacities anyway.

I was thinking about the mentions of SCM_RIGHTS.  Anyways, yeah, it
isn't possible to build any finer granularity than the existing
security domains.

I was curious why they wouldn't be able to use count-me-out knob.  The
white list was nasty but we did it anyway because there were some
horrible commands which, ISTR, could even affect other devices sharing
the bus and at least at the beginning the list of commands which
should be allowed were pretty compact.

While the list has grown over time, at times probably too carelessly,
I'm not sure it'd be a good idea to make it fully generic to the
extent where giving out write access to a user means SG_IO access to
most common commands by default.  Count-me-out is attractive mainly
because it involves an explicit step where the additional access is
granted.  It'd be nice if that's good enough for the common use cases.
If not, I don't know.

Whitelisting those commands is likely to be mostly harmless most of
the time but I would be surprised if there aren't devices out in the
wild which can be bricked / affected adversely with carefully crafted
commands within the allowed cdbs.  The level of security isolation
which can be provided by command code filtering is somewhat flimsy,
which is why cdb filtering was always seen as a kludge, which in turn
is why there's reluctance against extending it to more use cases.
