At mm-summit, it was discussed ant people seems to think user-land-oom-handler
is impossible. Hm, and in-kernel scripting was discussed, as far as I remember.

Considering only memcg, bypassing all charge-limit-check will work.
But as you say, that will not work against global-oom.
Then, in-kernel scripting was discussed.

I think that kinds of bypassing is acceptable.

How this happens ?

Someone may be against that kind of control and say "Hey, I have better idea".
That was another reason that oom-scirpiting was discussed. No one can implement
general-purpose-victim-selection-logic.

IMHO, it will be difficult but allowing to write script/filter for oom-killing
will be worth to try. like..

==
for_each_process :
   if comm == mem_manage_daemon :
      continue
   if user == root              :
      continue
   score = default_calc_score()
   if score > high_score :
      selected = current
==

BTW, if you love the logic in the userland oom daemon, why you can't implement
it in the kernel ? Does that do some pretty things other than sending SIGKILL ?

Thanks,
