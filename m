If you want to do that for an out-of-tree patch/module, feel free to do
so, but this has nothing to do with the in-kernel kdbusfs code, sorry.

What exactly do you mean here?  There are thousands of people who know
how to properly debug Linux kernel code, this isn't an issue at all.

What does cgroups have to do with dbus userspace libraries here?  In
fact, I don't think you looked at the code, as we properly tie into
namespaces and all the stuff you can only do in the kernel, you aren't
reading my introductory email at all that explains all of this.

And how exactly does this relate to the kdbusfs code?  Please, stop
making random statements that have nothing to do with the code being
proposed.

You heard wrong, the context switch removal is a big thing, and a major
issue for a lot of users.  But that's not the only reason this is being
proposed, again, go read and respond to the 00 patch introduction
please, or even better yet, read the code and documentation and respond
to issues you find there.

Again, FUSE makes no sense here, sorry.

I'm glad you agree with the current implementation, thanks for your
approval.
