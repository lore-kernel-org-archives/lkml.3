I've already been working on updating scsi logging infrastructure, 
removing old cludges and streamlining it.
I'm all in favour of moving things over to scsi tracing; in fact I've 
already moved all the current SCSI_ML_XXX statements to tracepoints in
my current patchset.

Unfortunately I haven't found time to test things out there, and there's 
the patchset from Yoshihiro which needs review and integration.

As of now I've treated this as rather low priority as no-one seemed to 
mind and the patchsets will be touching each and every driver.

I'll be updating the patchset and send it for review.

Cheers,

Hannes
