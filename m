Maybe so.  I'm not sure how.  d_materialise_unique is called from lookup
and we'd need to at least drop the parent i_mutex to give a concurrent
rename a chance to progress.

I think NFS or cluster filesystem clients could hit this case with:

	host A		host B
	---------	-------------------------
	process 1	process 1	process 2
	---------	---------	---------

			mkdir foo/X
	mv foo/X bar/
			stat bar/X	mv baz qux


When (B,1) looks up X in bar it finds that X still has an alias in foo,
tries to rename that alias to bar/X, but can't because the current
baz->qux rename is holding the rename mutex.  So __d_unalias and the
lookup return -EBUSY.

None of those operations are particularly fast, so I'm a bit surprised
we haven't already heard complaints.  I must be missing some reason this
doesn't happen.  I guess I should set up a test.

This only happens on the first (uncached) lookup.  So we've already
acquired a bunch of locks and probably done a round trip to a disk or a
server--is walking a (typically short) list really something to worry
about?

OK, I guess I don't care which one we keep.

I think I see what you mean, I can fix that.
