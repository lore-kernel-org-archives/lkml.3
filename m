Maybe we can piggy back the two on the same mechanism but as you said
the two issues are orthogonal.  Let's keep it that way for now.  We
need them separate anyway for backports.

I don't think async_schedule() is the right mechanism for this use
case as the mechanism is inherently opportunistic.  It also gets
tangled up with async synchronization at the end of module loading.

Why do we care about the priority of probing tasks?  Does that
actually make any meaningful difference?  If so, how?

I'm not sure about skipping for sync_probe flag.  That seems like an
implementation detail to me.  Sure, we do that now because we don't
have a better way of figuring out whether request_module() is waiting
for it or not but hopefully we'd be able to in the future.  I think we
just should make exceptions sensible so that it works fine in practice
for now (and I don't think that'd be too hard).  So, the only
cooperation necessary from userland would be just saying "I don't
wanna wait for device probing on module load."

Thanks.
