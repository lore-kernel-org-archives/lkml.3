I can see where you're going with that, yeah.

It'd make less sense as a splice extension, then, perhaps.  It'd be more
like a generic entry point for the existing ioctls.  Maybe even just
defining the semantics of a common ioctl.

Hmm.

Yeah, got me.  It's certainly nonsense on a lot of FTL logging
implementations (which are making their way into SMR drives in the
future).

No, it's fine.  At least people are expressing some interest in the
interface!  That's a marked improvement over the state of things in the
past.
