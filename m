Tejun:

The context is that we have been talking about
drivers/scsi/scsi_scan.c:scsi_rescan_device(), which is called by the
store_rescan_field() sysfs method in scsi_sysfs.c.  The problem is
this: What happens in scsi_rescan_device if the device is unbound from
its driver before the module_put call?  The dev->driver->owner
calculation would dereference a NULL pointer.

There are two types of methods to think about: Those registered by the 
subsystem and those registered by the driver.

If a method is registered by the driver, then the driver will
unregister it when the ->remove routine runs.  I don't know for
certain, but I would expect that the sysfs/kernfs core will make sure
that any existing method calls complete before unregister returns.  
This would prevent races.

If a method is registered by the subsystem, and if the method runs 
entirely within the subsystem's code, then ->remove doesn't matter.  
The driver could be unbound while the method is running and it would be 
okay.

The only time we have a problem is when the method is registered by the 
subsystem and the method calls into the driver.  (Note that this is 
exactly what happens with scsi_rescan_device.)

The sriov_numvfs_store method does have the same problem, and so does 
the reset_store method (by way of pci_reset_function -> 
pci_dev_save_and_disable -> pci_reset_notify).

Tejun, is my analysis correct?  How should we fix these races?
