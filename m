Worse than Wed Dec 31 23:59:59 UTC 1969, on NFSv3 it also means
"Sun Feb  7 07:28:15 CET 2106", and that is much harder to distinguish
from a real future date.

If we had the choice, I'd go for something like 1, i.e.
"Thu Jan  1 01:00:01 CET 1970".

It's harder for time(2), but for the inode case, we can definitely
detect when the file system specific representation overflows
or underflows, which may be be at a number of very different points
of time.
