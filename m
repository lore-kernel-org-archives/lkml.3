mds1: orig-file
oss1/target1: orig-chunk1

mds1: target-file
ossN/targetN: target-chunk1

clientN: Performs the copy

Ideally, orig-chunk1 and target-chunk1 are on the same server and same 
target. Copy offload then even could done from the underlying fs, 
similiar as local splice.
If different ossN servers are used copies still have to be done over 
network by these storage servers, although the client only would need to 
initiate the copy. Still faster, but also not ideal.

But it _does_ make sense. The file system just needs a hint that a 
splice copy is going to come up.

And exactly for that we need a standard - it does not make sense if each 
and every distributed file system implements its own 
ioctl/libattr/libacl interface for that.

pNFS, FhGFS, Lustre, Ceph, etc., all of them shall implement their own 
interface? And userspace needs to address all of them differently?

I'm just asking for something like a vfs ioctl SPLICE_META_COPY (sorry, 
didn't find a better name yet), which would take in-file-path and 
out-file-path and allow the file system to create out-file-path with the 
same meta-layout as in-file-path. And it would need some flags, such as 
AUTO (file system decides if it makes sense to do a local copy) and 
FORCE (always try a local copy).


Thanks,
Bernd
