Being able to set a single-user uid map and gid map is very useful for
sandboxing.  This lets unprivileged users drop filesystem and network
access and still run most normal programs.  A surprising number of
normal unprivileged programs fail if run without a mapping.

I do it all the time.  Unshare, set mappings (with no inner uid 0 at
all), set no_new_privs, drop caps, and go.

Can we try the intermediate approach?  If you set gid_map without
privilege and you have supplementary groups, then let the write to
gid_map succeed but prevent setgroups from ever working?  That should
only be a couple of lines of code longer than your patch, and it will
avoid breaking sandbox use cases.

If we want to get really fancy in the future, we could have a concept
of pinned groups.  That is, if you're in a userns and you're a member
of an unmapped group, then you can't drop that group.  (Actually, that
all by itself might be enough to fix this issue.)
