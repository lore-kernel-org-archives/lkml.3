Thanks for your suggestion.  I fully agree with you.  What I concern is
how to define this threshold.  A fixed value is very simple but too
inflexible.  If this value is too big, this lru list could never be
sorted.  So my proposal is that we set this value accroding to the
number of used inodes.  For example, if the number of used inodes is
10,000, this threshold could be set to 10 (10,000 x 0.1%).  Meanwhile,
we need to provide a sysfs interface to let user set this value.  Does
it make sense?

Thanks,
                                                - Zheng
