Could we please have some detailed information about the real-world
effect of this patchset?

You earlier said "My test platform is currently selling item in the
market.  And also I test my patch when my platform is working as if
real user uses it.".

But what were the problems which were observed in standard kernels and
what effect did this patchset have upon them?  Some quantitative
measurements will really help here.

I'm trying to get an understanding of how effective and important the
change is, whether others will see similar benefits.  I'd also like to
understand how *complete* the fix is - were the problems which you
observed completely fixed, or do outstanding problems remain?

Thanks.
