Back then, I believe we thought that the occasional wait when rewriting file
blocks wouldn't be noticeable.  Also, I naively failed to plan for it taking
two years and a change of employers to get back to this. :/

Here's what I saw in MAINTAINERS back in 2011:

MEMORY MANAGEMENT
L:      linux-mm@kvack.org
W:      http://www.linux-mm.org
S:      Maintained
F:      include/linux/mm.h
F:      mm/

Sorry I forgot to cc you directly.  I guess I should have run
get_maintainers.pl and cc'd everyone ... but MAINTAINERS didn't list any
specific recipients, only lists.

On my setup (various consumer SSDs and spinny disks, none of which support
T10DIF) I see that the maximum write latency with these patches applied is
about half of what it is without the patches.  But don't take my word for it;
Andy Lutomirski[1] says that his soft-rt latency-sensitive programs no longer
freak out when he applies the patch set.  Afaik, Google and Taobao run custom
kernels with all this turned off, so they should see similar latency
improvements too.

Obviously, I see no difference on the DIF disk.

Heh, this is complicated.

Before this patchset, all filesystems would block, regardless of whether or not
it was necessary.  ext3 would wait, but still generate occasional checksum
errors.  The network filesystems were left to do their own thing, so they'd
wait too.

After this patchset, all the disk filesystems except ext3 and btrfs will wait
only if the hardware requires it.  ext3 (if necessary) snapshots pages instead
of blocking, and btrfs provides its own bdi so the mm will never wait.  Network
filesystems haven't been touched, so either they provide their own wait code,
or they don't block at all.  The blocking behavior is back to what it was
before 3.0 if you don't have a disk requiring stable page writes.

(I will reconfirm this statement before sending out the next iteration.)

I will of course add all of this to the cover message.
