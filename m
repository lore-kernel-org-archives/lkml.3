It allows features like spinning before going to sleep, as well
as helping with RT patches.  But this really isn't the place to
discuss this - the ship has sailed and just about any semaphore
used for basic mutal exclusion has been converted to a mutex.

Complaints about that should be directed to Linus and/or the locking
primitive maintainers.

> So what contexts can mutexes be used in?

They can be used in process context only.  Please make sure to also
run any patches changing locking behaviour with CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING
enabled, as that will verify all this.

Because you always release it before returning.  Note that the
sparse static checker can verify that for you, if the functions
get to big, which sg_open might get close to.  Sparse is another
tool that I wish every patch author would run before submission.

Read Documentation/sparse.txt for details.

You can sleep under mutexes just fine, although in general it
is preferable to sleep too long with mutexes held.

The driver core uses sleeping calls like mutexes in all these code
pathes, so a call from these contexts will blow up immediately.

That's how the class_interfaces work, easily verified by code
inspection.  Unfortunately these interfaces aren't really documented,
but a patch to Greg who is in Cc now will take care of that.

That is correct.
