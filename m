Subject: [PATCH v1 10/11] locks: add a new "lm_owner_key" lock operation
Date: Fri, 31 May 2013 23:07:33 -0400
Message-Id: <1370056054-25449-11-git-send-email-jlayton@redhat.com>
In-Reply-To: <1370056054-25449-1-git-send-email-jlayton@redhat.com>
References: <1370056054-25449-1-git-send-email-jlayton@redhat.com>
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Currently, the hashing that the locking code uses to add these values
to the blocked_hash is simply calculated using fl_owner field. That's
valid in most cases except for server-side lockd, which validates the
owner of a lock based on fl_owner and fl_pid.

In the case where you have a small number of NFS clients doing a lot
of locking between different processes, you could end up with all
the blocked requests sitting in a very small number of hash buckets.

Add a new lm_owner_key operation to the lock_manager_operations that
will generate an unsigned long to use as the key in the hashtable.
That function is only implemented for server-side lockd, and simply
XORs the fl_owner and fl_pid.
