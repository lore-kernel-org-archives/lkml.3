Actually that is a complicated case for a compiler. Because of the two
different scopes. I think it only optimizes that on higher optimization
values. Cross scope analysis is not done at parsing time but more on
code generation time, the "warning" is more of the former phase.

Perhaps change the code, if possible, so the assign and use of "expire"
is under the last if (or the first)? That would be also easier on the
reader.

BTW: You are most probably right though, because here I do not have this
     problem. I guess it is the case of an old compiler with a certain
     compilation environment.

Thanks
