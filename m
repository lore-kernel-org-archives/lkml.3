FYI, I once tried to introduce something like this before, but my use
case was pretty weak so it was not accepted at the time. I don't think
there were any objections to the API itself though, and I think it's
potentially a good idea if you use case justifies it.

Two comments:

- Note that there are two rwsem implementations - if you are going to
add functionality to rwsem.h you want to add the same functionality in
rwsem-spinlock.h as well.

- I would prefer if you could avoid taking the wait_lock in your
rwsem.h implementation. In your use case (read lock is known to be
held), checking for sem->count < 0 would be sufficient to indicate a
writer is queued (or getting onto the queue). In the general case,
some architectures have the various values set up so that
RWSEM_WAITING_BIAS != RWSEM_ACTIVE_WRITE_BIAS - for these
architectures at least, you can check for waiters by looking if the
lowest bit of RWSEM_WAITING_BIAS is set in sem->count.
