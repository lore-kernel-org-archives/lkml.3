This particular problem comes down to the fact that 
scsi_rescan_device() accesses dev->driver without appropriate mutual 
exclusion.  SCSI's scan_mutex won't help because it doesn't protect 
dev->driver.  Rather, dev->driver is protected by dev->mutex, and so 
scsi_rescan_device() needs to use device_lock/unlock.

This suggests that the scan_mutex may not be necessary at all.
Historically, it seems to be quite old, predating the device model.  
Now that we have the device model, maybe scan_mutex simply isn't 
needed.

Scanning for channels or targets beneath a host should be protected by
shost->gendev.mutex.  Scanning for logical units beneath a target
should be protected by starget->dev.mutex.  Scanning for partitions 
beneath a SCSI drive should be protected by sdev->sdev_gendev.mutex.

James, here's a related question.  Suppose userspace writes to the 
rescan attribute file for a disk drive for sd_probe_async() has 
started.  What will happen?  What _ought_ to happen?  Do we need to 
call

	async_synchronize_full_domain(&scsi_sd_probe_domain);

somewhere in this pathway, or will it be okay?
