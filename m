Sure, but the real problem is not the block mapping or allocation
path - even if the test is changed to take that out of the picture,
we still have timestamp updates being done on every single page
fault. ext4, XFS and btrfs all do transactional timestamp updates
and have nanosecond granularity, so every page fault is resulting in
a transaction to update the timestamp of the file being modified.

That's why on XFS the log is showing up in the profiles.

So, even if we narrow the test down to just overwriting existing
blocks, we've still got a filesystem transaction per page fault
being done. IOWs, it's still just a filesystem overhead test....

Cheers,

Dave.
