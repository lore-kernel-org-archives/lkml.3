Yes, ok

And I do agree on the /proc/self/stat, it should always work, and it
does with this series. Permissions on f_cred are checked only if
current's cred change between ->open() and ->read(), and this check may
succeed, it depends on f_cred! so /proc/self/stat will work.

Ok, will recheck all of them soon. Thanks Andy.

Oh Andy, take a look at commit 935d8aabd4331f47 by Linus
Add file_ns_capable() helper function for open-time capability checking

Don't you see the same change as from my patches:
file_ns_capable() it uses the file->f_cred ! and yes it uses
security_capable() as with the patches I proposed... but in the code I
touched there is a need for security_capable_noaudit() also, I think.

Same logic! file->f_cred is already beeing/planned to be used.

That also goes for commit 6708075f104c3c9b0 by Eric,
userns: Don't let unprivileged users trick privileged users into setting the id_map

So Andy, what do you think? file->f_cred is already used to fix urgent
vulnerabilities, and now, everyone here knows that /proc/*/{stack,maps}
cab be used to leak ASLR...

Sorry, will respond, thanks.
