Ok, I think I'm starting to get it. It doesn't necessarily need a
reentrant mount or anything like that. Consider this case (which is not
even that unlikely):

Suppose there are two tasks calling unlink() on files in the same NFS
directory.

First task takes the i_mutex on the parent directory and goes to ask
the server to remove the file. Second task calls unlink just
afterward and blocks on the parent's i_mutex.

Now, a suspend event comes in and freezes the first task while it's
waiting on the response. It still holds the parent's i_mutex. Freezer
now gets to the second task and can't freeze it because the sleep on
that mutex isn't freezable.

So, not a deadlock per-se in this case but it does prevent the freezer
from running to completion. I don't see any way to solve it though w/o
making all mutexes freezable. Note that I don't think this is really
limited to NFS either -- a lot of other filesystems will have similar
problems: CIFS, some FUSE variants, etc...
