Subject: [PATCHv5 0/3] syscalls,x86: Add execveat() system call
Date: Wed, 22 Oct 2014 12:44:26 +0100

This patch set adds execveat(2) for x86, and is derived from Meredydd
Luff's patch from Sept 2012 (https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/9/11/528).

The primary aim of adding an execveat syscall is to allow an
implementation of fexecve(3) that does not rely on the /proc
filesystem.  The current glibc version of fexecve(3) is implemented
via /proc, which causes problems in sandboxed or otherwise restricted
environments.

Given the desire for a /proc-free fexecve() implementation, HPA
suggested (https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/11/556) that an execveat(2)
syscall would be an appropriate generalization.

Also, having a new syscall means that it can take a flags argument
without back-compatibility concerns.  The current implementation just
defines the AT_EMPTY_PATH and AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW flags, but other
flags could be added in future -- for example, flags for new namespaces
(as suggested at https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/11/474).

Related history:
 - https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/27/123 is an example of someone
   realizing that fexecve() is likely to fail in a chroot environment.
 - http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=514043 covered
   documenting the /proc requirement of fexecve(3) in its manpage, to
   "prevent other people from wasting their time".
 - https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=74481 documented that
   it's not possible to fexecve() a file descriptor for a script with
   close-on-exec set (which is possible with the implementation here).
 - https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=241609 described a
   problem where a process that did setuid() could not fexecve()
   because it no longer had access to /proc/self/fd; this has since
   been fixed.


Changes since v4, suggested by Eric W. Biederman:
 - Use empty filename with AT_EMPTY_PATH flag rather than NULL
   pathname to request fexecve-like behaviour.
 - Build pathname as "/dev/fd/<fd>/<filename>" (or "/dev/fd/<fd>")
   rather than using d_path().
 - Patch against v3.17 (bfe01a5ba249)

Changes since Meredydd's v3 patch:
 - Added a selftest.
 - Added a man page.
 - Left open_exec() signature untouched to reduce patch impact
   elsewhere (as suggested by Al Viro).
 - Filled in bprm->filename with d_path() into a buffer, to avoid use
   of potentially-ephemeral dentry->d_name.
 - Patch against v3.14 (455c6fdbd21916).
