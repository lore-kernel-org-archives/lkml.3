Thanks.  Fixed.

Ooh, do we really get to have a discussion about the Oxford Comma on
linux-kernel?  :-)

I haven't actually run this material past my editor (who is my wife, so
I need really convincing arguments to do it your way instead of hers),
but funnily we had a conversation about the Oxford Comma while on holiday
last week.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma has a reasonably
exhaustive discourse on the subject, and I learned that she's probably
primarily against it because of her journalism degree.

Good catch.  I think I started out with 'an fs', then expanded it to
"an filesystem" which of course is nonsense.
