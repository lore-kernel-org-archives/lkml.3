Hi,
Please supply the information that Martin Petersen asked
for.

I just examined a more recent Areca SAS RAID controller
and would describe it as the SCSI device from hell. One solution
to this problem is to modify the arcmsr driver so it returns
a more consistent set of lies to the management SCSI commands that
Martin is asking about.
