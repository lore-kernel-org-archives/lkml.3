Heh, perhaps this is why bug reports are so useful.  Your patch told me
where you thought the bug was but this report actually tells me where
the bug is: it's in scsi_probe_and_add_luns().  There's no way that
routine should reduce the refcount of a struct scsi_device.  It should
either leave it as it is, or if an sdevp is specified, increment the
reference and return the sdev in sdevp.  This should be enough
information for you to come up with the fix.  Please document it with
the actual bug details like you have above and I'll apply it.
