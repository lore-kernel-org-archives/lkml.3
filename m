OK, and most of this part is transitional.

blk_mq_init_flush() will become bigger in following patch.

OK.

It is sort of a queue since there is a double buffer flush queue.

the flush queue data is always obtained from this helper in both
legacy and mq case, which will take per-hw_queue flush queue.
