 From constants.c:
  * Updated to SPC-4 T10/1713-D Rev 36g, D. Gilbert 20130701

Not much has changed between then and now (37a). There is a
lot pending for SPC-5 plus all the ZBC stuff, little of which
has hit the drafts yet. WRITE ATOMIC and a few new asc/ascq
codes is about all that I have noticed. Even when new asc/ascq
strings are approved, it needs the SPC4/5 technical editor to
allocate numbers for them.

So even if the timing is good from the kernel POV, not much
is available. The next T10 meeting is in a few weeks, lets
see what happens there.
