Probably not.  I was recently reminded of it by some people on the C++
standards committee.  I had first heard of it about 5 years ago, but
hadn't heard definitively until quite recently.

I defer to the Itanium maintainers to actually make the required changes,
should they choose to do so.  I suppose that one way to handle it in the
Linux kernel would be to make ACCESS_ONCE() be architecture specific,
with Itanium placing a memory barrier either before or after --- either
would work.  But since Itanium seems to run Linux reliably, I am guessing
that the probability of misordering is quite low.  But again, the ball
is firmly in the Itanium maintainers' courts, and I have added them on CC.
