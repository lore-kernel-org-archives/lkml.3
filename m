This whole patch is a mess.  It does way to many things in one patch,
and it doesn't explain enough of it.

Please explain why you need it.  Especially as the PHY API is a generic
phy abstraction, so having to share defintions between the provider and
consumer seems wrong.  Even if you need some shared bits keep them to an
absolute minium insted of moving so much out of the driver directory.
Also if at all possible keep the shared data in a single header under
include/linux instead of having lots of global headers in a deep
directory structure.

Second split this into patches that do a single things, and explain why
you're doing each:

 1) header move if/as needed
 2) add 20nm phy driver
 3) add 28nm phy driver
 4) add ufs-qcom driver
 5) add ufs-qcom-ice support

and so on.
