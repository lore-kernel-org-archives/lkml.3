Okay. Thanks. I've added a few more words to the page noting that
the kernel maintains no state for a futex in the uncontended state.

Okay -- I've attempted to capture this in some text that I added to the 
page.

Sad to say, that document doesn't supply that much more detail, in
my reading of it, at least.

Now there's two other stories that have yet to be dealt with ;-). 

I have a FIXME already in the page regarding OWNERDIED, and
get_robust_list(2) is another page that seems like it could do with 
a fair bit of work, but that's a story for another day.

Cheers,
