Right; but if you wait for the 'unused' RMID to drop to 0 occupancy you
have a fair chance all lines have an active RMID tag. There are a few
corner cases where this is not so, but given the hardware this is the
best I could come up with.

Under constant L3 pressure it basically means that your new RMID
assignment has reached steady state (in as far as the workload has one
to begin with).

wbinv is actually worse in that it wipes everything, it will guarantee
any occupancy read will not over-report, but almost guarantees
under-reporting if you're 'quick'.

The only really sucky part is that we have to poll for this situation to
occur.

So I don't see the need for a custom controller; what's wrong with the
perf-cgroup approach I proposed?

The thing is, a custom controller will have to jump through most of the
same hoops anyway.

Yeah, just about every time an Intel person tells me I've been staring
at the wrong version -- usually several emails down a confused
discussion.

The even better option would be the TeX source of the document so we can
diff(1) for changes (and yes; I suspect you're not using TeX like you
should be :-).

Currently we manually keep histerical versions and hope to spot the
differences by hand, but its very painful.

OK; so in the Feb 2014 edition of the Intel SDM for x86_64...

Vol 3c, table 35-23, lists the QM_EVTSEL, QM_CTR and PQR_ASSOC as per
thread, which I read to mean per logical cpu.

(and here I ask what's a PQR)

Vol 3b. 17.14.7 has the following text:

"Thread access to the IA32_QM_EVTSEL and IA32_QM_CTR MSR pair should be
serialized to avoid situations where one thread changes the RMID/EvtID
just before another thread reads monitoring data from IA32_QM_CTR."

The PQR_ASSOC is also stated to be per logical CPU in 17.14.3; but that
same section fails to be explicit for the QM_* thingies.

So which is it; are the QM_* MSRs shared across threads or is it per
thread?

Vol 3b. 17.14.5.2 MBM is rather sparse, but what I can gather from the
text in 17.14.5 the MBM events work more like normal PMU events in that
once you program the QM_EVTSEL it starts counting.

However, there doesn't appear to be an EN bit, nor is CTR writable. So
it appears we must simply set EVTSEL, quickly read CTR as start value,
and at some time later (while also keeping track of time) read it again
and compute the lines/time for bandwidth?

I suppose that since we have multiple cores (or threads, depending on
how the MSRs are implemented) per L3 we can model the thing as having
that many counters.

A bit crappy because we'll have to IPI ourselves into oblivion to
control all those counters, a better deal would've been that many MSRs
package wide -- like the other uncore PMUs have.
