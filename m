This may be a foolish question, but why is xhci-hcd using no-op TRBs in 
the first place?

It makes sense that they would be needed if you have to unlink an URB 
that isn't the first one on the endpoint ring.  But usb-storage never 
does that; whenever it unlinks an URB, it always unlinks the earliest 
entry in the endpoint's queue.

After unlinking the first URB on the ring, you don't need to fill in
its TRBs with no-ops.  Instead, when you are ready to start the ring
againk, just tell the host controller to move the dequeue pointer up to
the start of the next surviving URB.  (You'll also have to adjust the
CYCLE bits of the TRBs that get skipped over, but that's trivial.)
