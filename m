Correct.

... and then leaks contents back to unprivileged process.

... and then parent snoops on file contents for the privileged child.

(Type 2 is solved currently, IIUC. Type 1 could be reduced in scope by
changing these file modes back to 0400.)

Type 1 can be done via exec as well. Instead of using a priv exec to
read an arbitrary process, read it could read its own.

I think revoking the fd would be great. Does that mechanism exist?
