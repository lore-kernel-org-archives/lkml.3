So, from someone who was done in the trenches of the large
filesystem block size code wars, the main objection to Christoph
lameter's patchset was that it used high order compound pages in the
page cache so that nothing at filesystem level needed to be changed
to support large block sizes.

The patch to enable XFS to use 64k block sizes with Christoph's
patches was simply removing 5 lines of code that limited the block
size to PAGE_SIZE. And everything just worked.

Given that compound pages are used all over the place now and we
also have page migration, compaction and other MM support that
greatly improves high order memory allocation, perhaps we should
revisit this approach.

As to Nick's fsblock rewrite, he basically rewrote all the
bufferhead head code to handle filesystem blocks larger than a page
whilst leaving the page cache untouched. i.e. the complete opposite
approach. The problem with this approach is that every filesystem
needs to be re-written to use fsblocks rather than bufferheads. For
some filesystems that isn't hard (e.g. ext2) but for filesystems
that use bufferheads in the core of their journalling subsystems
that's a completely different story.

And for filesystems like XFS, it doesn't solve any of the problem
with using bufferheads that we have now, so it simply introduces a
huge amount of IO path rework and validation without providing any
advantage from a feature or performance point of view. i.e. extent
based filesystems mostly negate the impact of filesystem block size
on IO performance...

Realistically, if I'm going to do something in XFS to add block size
> page size support, I'm going to do it wiht somethign XFS can track
through it's own journal so I can add data=journal functionality
with the same filesystem block/extent header structures used to
track the pages in blocks larger than PAGE_SIZE. And given that we
already have such infrastructure in XFS to support directory
blocks larger than filesystem block size....

FWIW, as to the original "large sector size" support question, XFS
already supports sector sizes up to 32k in size. The limitation is
actually a limitation of the journal format, so going larger than
that would take some work...

Cheers,

Dave.
