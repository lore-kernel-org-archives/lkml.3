And what parameters are you passing to security_ptrace_access_check?
It's supposed to be f_cred, right?  Because you want to make sure
that, if the opener had some low-privilege label, the target has
execed and gotten a more secure label, and the reader has a
high-privilege label, that the opener's label is checked against the
target's new label.
