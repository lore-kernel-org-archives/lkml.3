Hmm, the Fresco Logic host issue seems unrelated.

Ugh.  Well, I suppose we can chalk it up to hardware failure?  I think
you're the only one to report a verified issue with the Link TRB patch.

You are sure you're running a vanilla 3.12.7 kernel, right?

No, at least not this particular host-dying-only-on-one-machine failure
mode.

I think any patches I was going to send are moot with this new
information.  The issue with your PCI add-in card only happens in
combination with a specific motherboard, so I don't think it makes sense
to disable the no-op TRBs for that host.

If lots of other people start reporting the same issue with the ASMedia
0.96 host, and reverting commit 35773dac5f862cb1c82ea151eba3e2f6de51ec3e
"usb: xhci: Link TRB must not occur within a USB payload burst" helps
them, then I'll reconsider that decision.

Thank you so much for your patience while debugging this issue, and
being willing to try all sorts of kernels and patches.  I'm glad we
finally figured out what the issue was, and you have working xHCI hosts
now.
