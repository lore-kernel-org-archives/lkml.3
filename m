So the patch formatting doesn't make it completely clear what's going on
here, but here's what the original nfs_file_direct_write code did:

- called with i_mutex unlocked
- collects stats and does some generic checks
- locks i_mutex
- syncs the mapping, schedules the write
- unlocks i_mutex
- waits for the write to complete if synchronous

After this patch, nfs_file_direct_write works like:

- called with i_mutex locked
- collects stats and does some generic checks
- syncs the mapping, schedules the write
- drops i_mutex
- waits for the write to complete if synchronous
- picks i_mutex back up

There's an extra lock and unlock as a result and a slightly longer
critical section, but we drop i_mutex to wait for the write, so multiple
writes still work in parallel.
