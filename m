I expect cgroupfs to behave exactly as it would in the initial namespace.
Such that the container can do with it whatever it wants.
systemd mounts and manages cgroups on its own.
Like for CONFIG_DEVPTS_MULTIPLE_INSTANCES.

If a new cgroup namespace cannot provide a clean and autonomous cgroupfs
instance it is fundamentally flawed.
You cannot provide a namespace mechanism which depends on the host side
that much.
This will also horrible break container migrations between hosts.
i.e. Migrate a container from a Ubuntu host to a Fedora (systemd!) host.

Why can't cgroup namespace change this?
I think of cgroup namespace as a new and clean cgroupfs instance which inherits
all limits from the outside.

As I've stated above I expect from cgroup namespaces a clean and sane
cgroupfs instance no matter how the outer mounts are.
