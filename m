Hello, guys.

So, I think this is why implementing freezer as a separate blocking
mechanism isn't such a good idea.  We're effectively introducing a
completely new waiting state to a lot of unsuspecting paths which
generates a lot of risks and eventually extra complexity to work
around those.  I think we really should update freezer to re-use the
blocking points we already have - the ones used for signal delivery
and ptracing.  That way, other code paths don't have to worry about an
extra stop state and we can confine most complexities to freezer
proper.

Thanks.
