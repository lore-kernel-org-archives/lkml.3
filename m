While you are niftily avoiding to talk about the nature of the lock, I
can take it for granted that you are talking about user space
spinlocks, right?

Simply if you would talk about futexes and pthread_mutexes then it
would have occured to you while implementing that feature, that the
kernel already has a mechanism to record a reference to a user space
data structure (robust_list_head) which is updated when a futex is
acquired in user space, i.e. when a critical section is entered. It's
not the same as you need, but it would be relatively simple to convey
that information there.

So what are the actual lock types and use cases and why can't you
combine that with the existing robust list mechanism?

And that deassertion has which consequences before the next preempt
check happens?

No. First of all this wants to be a proper struct declaration outside
of task_struct.

Aside of that your user space side is actually a structure and not a
opaque u32 pointer, so this should be an explicit data type and not
something randomly defined in the guts of task_struct.

Can you please get rid of the leftovers of your previous patches
yourself and before posting? It's annoying as hell to review patches
which contain stale code.

Sigh. We do not sprinkle that kind of #ifdef crap all over the
place. That's what inline functions in header files are for.

Looking at that mess makes me palying^Wpale.

So what happens if:

   kernel.preempt_delay_available = 1;
   
   prctl(PR_SET_PREEMPT_DELAY, ...);

   kernel.preempt_delay_available = 0;

Nothing happens at all because you fail to give the sysop control over
the feature once you unleashed it.

The proper solution for this is to use a static key to control the
feature itself. That also reduces the overhead for those who are not
interested in that.

check_preempt_tick() clearly does not care about that, but you inflict
a smp_processor_id() on every caller. I can see that you really care
about performance.

Surely we need to recheck delay_req here.

This is really a well designed kernel/user space interface. NOT.

Why on earth do we need two flags here? Just because we can create
more code in the guts of the scheduler hot pathes that way?

And surely we want to put them into two adjacent u8 to make life
easier for all architectures.

This is the completely wrong argument. We know that the task was
asking for an extra time slice because the copy from user above
succeeded. So we are better of to let the task actually handle its
pagefault than scheduling it out.

Sigh.

And all of this needs to be in kernel/sys.c just because...

So 4 bytes is a perfect boundary for everyone, right? Pulled that

Brilliant comment. I can see what the code is doing. What's way more
interesting and of course undocumented is why you are ignoring the
return value of put_user() ..

> +	put_user(0, (uint32_t *)preempt_delay_addr);

Aside of the general issues I have with this (see the inline replies
to your changelog) the overall impression of this patch is that it is
a half baken and carelessly cobbled together extract of some data base
specific kernel hackery, which I prefer not to see at all.

Thanks,
