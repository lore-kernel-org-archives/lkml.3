So, it writes a 128MB file sequentially via mmap page faults. This
isn't a page fault benchmark, as such...

Yup, apparently they've been pulled into the xfsdev tree, but i
haven't seen it updated since they were pulled in so the linux-next
builds aren't picking up the fixes yet.

Sorry, what? What filesystems are you comparing here? XFS is
anything but new...

> I expected xfs to do a _lot_ better than it did.

perf diff doesn't tell me anything about how you should expect the
workload to scale.

This workload appears to be a concurrent write workload using
mmap(), so performance is going to be determined by filesystem
configuration, storage capability and the CPU overhead of the
page_mkwrite() path through the filesystem. It's not a page fault
benchmark at all - it's simply a filesystem write bandwidth
benchmark.

So, perhaps you could describe the storage you are using, as that
would shed more light on your results. A good summary of what
information is useful to us is here:

http://xfs.org/index.php/XFS_FAQ#Q:_What_information_should_I_include_when_reporting_a_problem.3F

And FWIW, it's no secret that XFS has more per-operation overhead
than ext4 through the write path when it comes to allocation, so
it's no surprise that on a workload that is highly dependent on
allocation overhead that ext4 is a bit faster....

Cheers,

Dave.
