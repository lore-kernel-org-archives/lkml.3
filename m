Alright, I took a look at this. My understanding is that a PREALLOC extent
represents a region on disk that has already been allocated but isn't in use
yet, but please correct me if I'm wrong. Judging by this comment in
btrfs_get_blocks_direct, we don't have to worry about PREALLOC extents in
general:

/*
 * We don't allocate a new extent in the following cases
 *
 * 1) The inode is marked as NODATACOW.  In this case we'll just use the
 * existing extent.
 * 2) The extent is marked as PREALLOC.  We're good to go here and can
 * just use the extent.
 *
 */

A couple of other considerations that cropped up:

- btrfs_get_extent does a bunch of extra work if the extent is not cached in
  the extent map tree that would be nice to avoid when swapping
- We might still have to do a COW if the swap file is in a snapshot

We can avoid the btrfs_get_extent by pinning the extents in memory one way or
another in btrfs_swap_activate.

The snapshot issue is a little tricker to resolve. I see a few options:

1. Just do the COW and hope for the best
2. As part of btrfs_swap_activate, COW any shared extents. If a snapshot
happens while a swap file is active, we'll fall back to 1.
3. Clobber any swap file extents which are in a snapshot, i.e., always use the
existing extent.

I'm partial to 3, as it's the simplest approach, and I don't think it makes
much sense for a swap file to be in a snapshot anyways. I'd appreciate any
comments that anyone might have.
