Al, I'm sorry if I missed a question or concern of yours back in
October -- I certainly didn't intend to (that would be foolish indeed!).

[I thought the main open question was whether a dupfs
implementation would help with /dev/fd/ and /proc/ semantics, but I
had the (possibly incorrect) understanding that that was somewhat
orthogonal to the execveat implementation.]

Are there any changes/fixes/refactorings that I could do (especially
within the 3.19 timeframe) that would help mollify at all?

Not me!
