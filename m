OK, I meant that it also clears the bits that are not specified in
DR6_RESERVED mask.

Then we should do

	- #define DR6_RESERVED    0xFFFF0FF0
	+ #define DR6_RESERVED    0xFFFFFFFFFFFF0FF0

?

or what? (just in case, I will happily agree with "do nothing" ;)

Which one?

	/* Define reserved bits in DR6 which are always set to 1 */
	#define DR6_RESERVED    (0xFFFF0FF0UL)

	/* Filter out all the reserved bits which are preset to 1 */
	dr6 &= ~DR6_RESERVED;

I guess both should be updated then. But if I read the doc correctly
the lower reserved bits are set to 1.

However do_debug() does set_debugreg(0, 6) and this looks correct, the
doc says "debug handlers should clear the register before returning to
the interrupted task".

Oleg.
