Hmm.  We can land in here from writeback, in which case the time
should be updated unconditionally.  We can also land in here from
msync(MS_ASYNC) or munmap.  munmap at least shouldn't block.

The nasty case is if a page is dirtied, then the frozen level is set
to SB_FREEZE_PAGEFAULT, and then userspace calls munmap or msync
*before* writepages gets called.  In this case, blocking until the fs
is unfrozen is probably impolite, and returning without updating the
time is questionable.

Removing the check entirely may add a new race, though: what if
.flush_cmtime has called mapping_test_clear_cmtime but hasn't gotten
to updating the time yet when freezing finishes?  This could be
prevented by changing generic_flush_cmtime to do __sb_start_write(sb,
SB_FREEZE_FS, false) and doing nothing if the fs is already frozen.
