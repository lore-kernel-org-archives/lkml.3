Maybe - I'm not an ext4 expert - but even if you can make it work
for ext4 in some way, that doesn't mean it is possible for any other
filesystem to use the same method. You're adding code to generic,
non-filesystem specific code paths and so the solutions need to be
generic rather not tied to how a specific filesystem is implemented.

Cheers,

Dave.
