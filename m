    __filemap_fdatawrite_range or __writeback_single_inode
      do_writepages
	->writepages
	  xfs_vm_writepages
	    write_cache_pages
	      ->writepage
	        xfs_vm_writepage

So explicit data flushes or background writeback still end up in
xfs_vm_writepage.

The difference is that we have an explicit transaction handle in XFS
which defines the transaction context. i.e. we don't hide
transactions in thread contexts - the transaction defines the atomic
context of the modification being made.....

The same one we use now.

But that's exactly my point.  i.e. the transaction handle belongs to
the operation being executed, not the thread that is currently
executing it.  We also hand transaction contexts to IO completion,
do interesting things with log space reservations for operations
that require multiple commits to complete and so pass state when
handles are duplicated prior to commit, etc. We still need direct
manipulation and control of the transaction structure, regardless of
where it is stored.

Cheers,

Dave.
