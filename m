I think we will want a framework in the tree, but it can be very
minimal.  But I also think that using exit(2) for this is wrong.  Why
not:

enum ktest_result {
  KTEST_PASS,
  ...,
};

void ktest_exit(enum ktest_result result);

With the possibility of further extensions for more than one test (and
associated result) per execution of the test binary.
