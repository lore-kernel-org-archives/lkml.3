Changing the VM unit of allocation is a major VM overhawl

No. The PAGE_CACHE_SIZE would depend on the underlying address space and
vary. The large block patchset would have to have done this but I did not
go back and review the patches due to lack of time. With that it starts
hitting into fragmentation problems that have to be addressed somehow and
cannot just be waved away.

That's taking the approach of the large block patchset (as I understand
it, not reviewed, not working on this etc) without dealing with potential
fragmentation problems. Of course they could be remapped virtually if
necessary but that will be very constrained on 32-bit, the final transfer
to hardware will require scatter/gather and there is a setup/teardown
cost with virtual mappings such as faulting (setup) and IPIs to flush TLBs
(teardown) that would add overhead.
