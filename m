Once you start looking at what is already in the list, you'll see that
your problem is entirely theoretical, and any choice is going to be arbitrary.
There are already plenty of enabled commands that are not implemented by
most SCSI devices (not just cheap USB enclosures), and I don't see what
the difference should be between say "LOG SELECT" and "ORWRITE".

Ok, so I looked at the list.  The vast majority of the commands are
added because Linux itself is using them.

Considering only commands that have a "D" (i.e. are supported by
"normal" disks), these maybe can be removed from patch 9.  Probably
no one would notice:

+       sgio_bitmap_set(0x07, D|      W|  O                  , write); // REASSIGN BLOCKS
+       sgio_bitmap_set(0x29, D|      W|R|O                  , read);  // READ GENERATION
+       sgio_bitmap_set(0x2C, D|        R|O                  , write); // ERASE(10)
+       sgio_bitmap_set(0x8B, D                              , write); // ORWRITE

These two are no-ops so I won't cry too much for them:

+       sgio_bitmap_set(0x34, D|      W|  O|        K        , read);  // PRE-FETCH(10)
+       sgio_bitmap_set(0x90, D|      W|  O|      B          , read);  // PRE-FETCH(16)

Everything else has to stay.

For tapes and media changers, all of the commands have to stay.
