youre right. i am only afraid of silent corruption of data on aborts:
our guys here trigger OOM all the time with their compilers and
numerical codes (go figure).
and until now we had no more aborts / panics because of
"vm.min_free_kbytes = 65536" and thus no corruption.

my point is:
i like a freezing computer more than an corrupting computer, even if
its a server. reboot to the rescue.
