So, I want to make sure that I am clear on what you mean you say this.
You say "there is no such thing as a futex" because from the kernel's
perspective there is no visible entity in the uncontended case
(where everything can be dealt with in user space). And from user-space,
in the uncontended case all we're doing is memory operations. Right?

On the other hand, from a kernel perspective, we could say that a 
futex "exists" in the contended phases, since the kernel has allocated
state associated with the uaddr. Right?

> A "futex" becomes a PI futex when it is "created" via a PI futex op code.

Precisely which PI op codes? Is it: FUTEX_LOCK_PI, FUTEX_TRYLOCK_PI, and
FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE_PI, and not FUTEX_WAIT_REQUEUE_PI or FUTEX_UNLOCK_PI?

Not quite that bad, but... The thing is, still, the man page has text
such as the following (based on your wording):

       FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE_PI (since Linux 2.6.31)
              This operation is a PI-aware variant of FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE.
              It    requeues    waiters    that    are    blocked    via
              FUTEX_WAIT_REQUEUE_PI  on uaddr from a non-PI source futex
              (uaddr) to a PI target futex (uaddr2).

And elsewhere you said

    EINVAL is returned if the non-pi to pi or 
    op pairing semantics are violated.

When someone in user-land (e.g., me) reads pieces like that, they then 
want to find somewhere in the man page a description of what makes a 
futex a *PI futex* and probably some statements of the distinction 
between PI and non-PI futexes. And those statements should be from a 
perspective that is somewhat comprehensible to user-space. I'm not
yet confident that I can do that. Do you care to take a shot at it?

Yes, Jan Kiszka recently alerted me to the existence of 
https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11588
and I still have some text that you proposed (mail titled
("Pthread Condition Variables and Priority Inversion")
quite a long time ago for the pthread_cond_timedwait() page.
One day, when that page exists, I'll try to remember to add it.

Thanks. I've added some text on pairing, based on your text above.

I don't think we need that much level of detail.

Thanks.
