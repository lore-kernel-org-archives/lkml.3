Actually... I believe it was the right instinct. 

If I wanted to recover the data... remount-r would be the way to
go. Then back it up using dd_rescue. ... But that way I'd turn bad
sectors into silent data corruption.

If I wanted to recover data from that partition, fsck -c (or
badblocks, but that's trickier) and then dd_rescue would be the way to go.

Actually -- tool to do relocations would be nice. It is not exactly
easy to do it right by hand.

I know the theory. I had 5 read-error incidents this year.

#1: Seagate refuses to reallocate sectors. Not sure why, I tried
 pretty much everything.

#2: 3.16-rc1 produces incorrect errors every 4GB, leading to "bad
sectors" that disappear with other kernels

#3: Some more bad sectors appear on the Seagate

#4: Kernel on thinkpad reports errors in daily check. Which is strange
 because there's nothing in SMART.

#5: Some old IDE hdd has bad sectors in unused or unimportant areas. 

In #5 the theory might match the reality (I did not check, I trashed
the disks).

Forcing reallocation is hard & tricky. You may want to simply mark it
bad and lose a tiny bit of disk space... And even if you want to force
reallocation, you want to do fsck -c, first, and restore affected
files from backup.
