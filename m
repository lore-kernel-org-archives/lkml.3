Ok. The only caution I have if Arve isn't involved is that we have in
the past merged cleanup changes that introduced bugs, and it wasn't
until Arve took at look at the new kernel that these were sorted out
(see e194fd8a5d8e0a7eeed239a8534460724b62fe2d). So I think if at all
possible getting his ack on things would be good.

Alright then.

You reference this issue quite a bit, and I have a handwavy sense of
the problem, but do you have a more detailed link to the specific
issue here?

Well, the longer something is in the kernel, the more likely someone
will depend on it.

Well, realistically, those millions of devices out there will almost
*never* get a kernel version bump

But yes, I'm fine with it going in. I'm just a bit surprised at how
quickly thoughts change here.

This does raise the question if the same standard could be held to
ashmem then? That's a *much* simpler and easier to maintain chunk of
code, and is just as isolated, logic wise.  And while I think it would
be ideal if the unpinning feature could be done more generically, if
volatile ranges really doesn't have a future, then its maybe silly to
hold ashmem out as well?

thanks
