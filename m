See my previous message. If we use O_DIRECT on the original open, then
filesystems that implement bmap but not direct_IO will no longer work.
These are the ones that I found in my tree:

adfs
befs
bfs
ecryptfs
efs
freevxfs
hpfs
isofs
minix
ntfs
omfs
qnx4
qnx6
sysv
ufs

Several of these are read only, and I can't imagine that anyone is using
a swapfile on any of the rest, but if someone is, this would be a
regression, wouldn't it?
