Original posting:

There are a *LOT* of memory debugging options.  They are just scattered
all over the "Kernel Hacking" menu.  Sure, "memory debugging" is a very
vague term and it's going to be hard to make absolute rules about what
goes in here, but this has to be better than what we had before.

This does, however, leave out the architecture-specific memory
debugging options (like x86's DEBUG_SET_MODULE_RONX).  There would need
to be some substantial changes to move those in here.  Kconfig can not
easily mix arch-specific and generic options together: it really
requires a file per-architecture, and I think having an
arch/foo/Kconfig.debug-memory might be taking things a bit too far
