I wonder if we could do something vaguely like

	struct lock_owner_common {
		struct file_lock *blocker;
	};

	struct nlmsvc_lock_owner {
		struct lock_owner_common owner;
		unsigned int client_pid;
	};

and make fl_owner a (struct lock_owner_common *) and have lockd create
nlmsvc_lock_owners as necessary on the fly.  The lm_compare_owner
callback could then be replaced by a pointer comparison.  I'm not sure
what kind of locking or refcounting might be needed.  But...

sounds fine.
