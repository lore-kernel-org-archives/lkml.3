Subject: Re: [PATCH v2] Setting the IORESOURCE_ROM_SHADOW flag on a VGA card
 other than the primary prevents it from reading it's own rom. It will get
 the content of the shadowrom at C000 instead, which is of the primary VGA
 card and the driver of the secondary card will bail out.

No need, I applied this to my pci/misc branch for v3.15.

Tony, let me know if you have any issues with this.
