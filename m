Wait, that's not right at all.  There looks to be a thinko in the
command pool handling code.  We have both a cmd_pool in the host
structure and in the host template structure, but there's confusion
about which one we're supposed to be using.

The origin of confusion seems to be the reference counting in the pool
itself ... you want the same pool for all hosts, since they can only
have one cmd_size, but you want it created on first host use and
destroyed again on the last one.

If you take this patch, a host that attached, detaches and then attaches
a host will panic because it will use a freed pool structure.

This whole mess is created by the attempt to refcount the pools.  What's
wrong with simply creating the pool at init time and deleting it again
at module removal ... that way no refcounting and no bogus problems like
this (and we can delete the cmd_pool from the host).  The restriction
this would give is that cmd_size can only be set in the template, but
that seems to be the only safe use anyway, since any driver trying to
vary this in its host add routines will get unexpected results.
