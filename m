sched/fair: Add advisory flag for borrowing a timeslice

This patch adds a way for a task to request to borrow one timeslice
from future if it is about to be preempted, so it could delay
preemption and complete any critical task it is in the middle of.

This feature improves performance for apps that use userspace locking
across large number of threads, for example large databases and Java,
and similar solutions have been used for many years on other OSs.
This feature helps in situation where a task acquires a lock before
performing a critical operation on shared data and happens to have
acquired the lock just before its timeslice is up which means it gets
preempted before it completes its task. This lock being held causes
all other tasks that also acquire the same lock to perform their
critical operation on shared data, to start queueing up and causing
large number of context switches. This queueing problem can be avoided
if the task that acquires lock first could request scheduler to let it
borrow one timeslice once it enters its critical section and hence
allow it to complete its critical section without causing queueing
problem. If critical section completes before the task is due for
preemption, the task can desassert its request which causes scheduler
to proceed with normal preemption. A task sends the scheduler this
request by setting a flag in a memory location it has shared with the
kernel. Kernel uses bytes in the same memory location to let the task
know when its request for amnesty from preemption has been granted.

These rules apply to the use of this feature:

- Request to borrow timeslice is not guranteed to be honored.
- If the task is allowed to borrow, kernel will inform the task
  of this. When this happens, task must yield the processor as soon
  as it completes its critical section.
- If the task fails to yield processor after being allowed to
  borrow, it is penalized by not honoring its next request for
  extra timeslice.
- Task is charged additional time for the borrowed timeslice as
  accumulated run time. This pushes it further down in consideration
  for the next task to run.

This feature was tested with a TPC-C workload. TPC-C workload shows
a 3% improvement in tpcc throughput when using this feature, which
is a significant improvement.

A new sysctl tunable kernel.preempt_delay_available enables this
feature at run time. The kernel boots up with this feature disabled
by default.

Documentation file included in this patch contains details on how to
use this feature, and conditions associated with its use. This patch
also adds a new field in scheduler statistics which keeps track of
how many times a task was granted amnesty from preemption.

---

With this new version of this patch, the kernel will not enable
preemption delay by default. This feature must be turned on by using
sysctl tunable kernel.preempt_delay_available. With this change, there
are now two ways to eliminate the impact of this feature on systems
that do not intend to use it and are sensitive to scheduling delays
that may be caused by the use of this feature. This feature can be
configured out for custom built kernels. For pre-compiled kernels where
this feature may have been configured in, it will stay off until enabled
through sysctl tunable.

Changelog:
v4:
	- Added a shared data structure to define the memory location
	  used for requesting preemption delay.
	- Fixed a hole in the code that allowed preemption delay to
	  continue to happen if preemption delay feature was disabled
	  with sysctl after a task had already started using this.
	- Removed the restriction on setting location of shared data
	  structure only when one is not set currently.
	- Moved almost all conditionally compiled code into header files
	- Cleaned up config dependency for CONFIG_SCHED_PREEMPT_DELAY
	- Changed permission on preempt_delay_available sysctl to allow
	  users to read it.
	- Updated documentation file to match the code changes
v3:
	- Use prctl() syscall to give kernel the location for shared flag 
	  instead of using a proc file.
	- Disabled this feature by default on a newly booted kernel and
	  added a sysctl tunable to enable/disable it at runtime.
v2:
	- Replaced mmap operation with a more memory efficient futex
	  like communication between userspace and kernel
	- Added a flag to let userspace know if it was granted amnesty
	- Added a penalty for tasks failing to yield CPU when they
	  are granted amnesty from pre-emption

v1:
	- Initial RFC patch with mmap for communication between userspace
	  and kernel

+=================================
+What is preemption delay feature?
+=================================
+
+There are times when a userspace task is executing a critical section
+which gates a number of other tasks that want access to the same
+critical section. If the task holding the lock that guards this critical
+section happens to grab the lock just before its timeslice is up and is
+preempted by the scheduler, scheduler ends up scheduling other
+tasks which immediately try to grab the lock to enter the critical
+section. This only results in lots of context switches as tasks wake up
+and go to sleep immediately. If on the other hand, the original task
+were allowed to run for an extra timeslice, it could have completed
+executing its critical section allowing other tasks to make progress
+when they get scheduled. Preemption delay feature allows a task to
+request scheduler to let it borrow one extra timeslice, if possible.
+
+
+==================================
+Using the preemption delay feature
+==================================
+
+This feature is compiled in the kernel by setting
+CONFIG_SCHED_PREEMPT_DELAY in kernel configuration. By default, the
+kernel boots up with this feature disabled. Enable it using sysctl
+tunable kernel.preempt_delay_available. Once this feature is
+enabled, the userspace process communicates with the kernel using a
+4-byte memory location in its address space. This location must be
+aligned to 4-byte boundary. It first gives the kernel address for this
+memory location by making a prctl() system call with PR_SET_PREEMPT_DELAY
+option. This memory location is interpreted as the following data
+structure (defined in linux/sched.h):
+
+struct sched_delay_req {
+	unsigned char nopreempt;	/* flag to request preemption delay */
+	unsigned char yield;		/* flag from kernel indicating  */
+					/* preemption delay was granted */
+	unsigned char rsvd[2];		/* reserved */
+};
+
+Task requests a preemption delay by writing a non-zero value to the
+first byte - nopreempt. Scheduler checks this value before preempting
+the task. Scheduler can choose to grant one and only an additional
+time slice to the task for each delay request but this delay is not
+guaranteed. If scheduler does grant an additional timeslice, it will
+set the flag in second byte. Upon completion of the section of code
+where the task wants preemption delay, task should check the second byte.
+If the flag in second byte is set, it should clear this flag and call
+sched_yield() so as to not hog the processor. If a thread was granted
+additional timeslice and it fails to call sched_yield(), scheduler
+will penalize it by denying its next request for additional timeslice.
+Following sample code illustrates how to use this feature:
+
+#include <linux/sched.h>
+
+int main()
+{
+	unsigned char buf[256];
+	struct sched_delay_req delay;
+
+	bzero(&delay, sizeof(delay));
+
+	/* Tell kernel where the flag lives */
+	prctl(PR_SET_PREEMPT_DELAY, &delay);
+
+	while (/* some condition is true */) {
+		/* do some work and get ready to enter critical section */
+		delay.nopreempt = 1;
+		/*
+		 * Obtain lock for critical section
+		 */
+		/*
+		 * critical section
+		 */
+		/*
+		 * Release lock for critical section
+		 */
+		delay.nopreempt = 0;
+		/* Give the CPU up if required */
+		if (delay.yield) {
+			delay.yield = 0;
+			sched_yield();
+		}
+		/* do some more work */
+	}
+	/*
+	 * Tell kernel we are done asking for preemption delay
+	 */
+	prctl(PR_SET_PREEMPT_DELAY, NULL);
+}
+
+
+====================
+Scheduler statistics
+====================
+
+Preemption delay features adds a new field to scheduler statictics -
+nr_preempt_delayed. This is a per thread statistic that tracks the
+number of times a thread was granted amnesty from preemption when it
+requested for one. "cat /proc/<pid>/task/<tid>/sched" will list this
+number along with other scheduler statistics.
+
+
+=====
+Notes
+=====
+
+1. If the location of shared flag is not aligned to 4-byte boundary,
+   prctl() will terminate with EFAULT.
+2. Userspace app should zero out the sched_delay_req structure before
+   giving kernel the address of this structure. Stale data in this
+   structure could cause unintended requests for preemption delay.
