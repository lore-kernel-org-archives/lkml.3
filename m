It's not clear what the operative assumptions are.  The comment in
blk_register_queue() implies that bypass is active only because it was
set up that way when the queue was created.  The fact that
blk_unregister_queue() doesn't call blk_queue_bypass_start() seems to
support this view -- although it could also be a simple oversight.

Hopefully Tejun can clear this iup.

Indeed, it does not work.

Tejun, for more details about the failure see the initial message in
