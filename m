WARN_ON_ONCE is probably pointless.

No objection from me. I was previously thinking about the "proper"
size for something that is a file name. So I originally wanted to use
PATH_MAX instead but ended up with PAGE_SIZE for reasons I do not
remember now.  Maybe we can use NAME_MAX instead. I just do not like to
use page allocator directly when allocatating something like strings
etc...

To be honest, I do not care much which way to go.
