The compiler should be able to optimize those to basically the same
code.  AFAICS, everything the code tests is trivially known to be
without side-effect to the compiler.  Besides, even if the compiler
generates slightly less efficient code, which it shouldn't, it's
highly unlikely that this level of micro CPU cycle optimization would
be measureable for something as heavy as [bc]fq.

Isn't the optimization "not idling" when these conditions are met?
Shouldn't the comparison be against the benefit of "not idling
selectively" vs "always idling" when blkcg is in use?

Another problem there is that this not only depends on the number of
processes but the number of threads in it.  cgroup is moving away from
allowing threads of a single process in different cgroups, so this
means that the operation can fluctuate in a very unexpected manner.

I'm not really convinced about the approach.  With rotating disks, we
know that allowing queue depth > 1 generaly lowers both throughput and
responsiveness and brings benefits in quite restricted cases.  It
seems rather backwards to always allow QD > 1 and then try to optimize
in an attempt to recover what's lost.  Wouldn't it make far more sense
to actively maintain QD == 1 by default and allow QD > 1 in specific
cases where it can be determined to be more beneficial than harmful?

It looks like a lot of complexity for optimization for a very
specific, likely unreliable (in terms of its triggering condition),
use case.  The triggering condition is just too specific.

Heh, that's 60GB ATA-100 hard drive.  Had no idea those are still
being produced.  However, my point still is that the design should be
focused on queued devices.  They're predominant in the market and
it'll only continue to become more so.  What bothers me is that the
scheduler essentially loses control and shows sub-optimal behavior on
queued devices by default and that's how it's gonna perform in vast
majority of the use cases.

blk-mq is right around the corner and newer devices won't travel this
path at all.  Hopefully, ahci too will be served through blk-mq too
when it's connected to ssds, so its usefulness for high performance
devices will diminsh rather quickly over the coming several years.  It
sure would be nice to still be able to carry some optimizations but it
does shift the trade-off balance in terms of how much extra complexity
is justified.

Thanks.
