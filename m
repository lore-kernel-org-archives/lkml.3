Could you please add an analysis of the actual failure; which devices
and what conditions.

Don't do this ... you're mixing a feature (which you'd need to justify)
with an apparent bug fix.

Once you dump all the complexity, I think the patch boils down to a
simple check before the action switch in scsi_io_completion():

	if (action !=  ACTION_FAIL &&
	    time_before(cmd->jiffies_at_alloc + wait_for, jiffies)) {
		action = ACTION_FAIL;
		description = "command timed out";
	}
