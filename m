Thanks, Jan, it's much clearer now what I need to do.

All right, so I need to find out how I can direct the new ioctl to
file-systems as well. I thought that I could get away with it by simply looking
at which file-systems have the same block device as the one to which the ioctl
is directed, but IIUC this doesn't make sense as NFS doesn't use a block device
at all.

So after I've figured out how to direct this new ioctl to a file-system, I need
to understand out how to invalidate a specific range of data. I will gracefully
fail metadata invalidation operations with EOPNOTSUPP or ENOSYS.

OK that I can do.

I suppose we'll always fail metadata invalidation operations when the target
of the ioctl is a block device.

Thanks
