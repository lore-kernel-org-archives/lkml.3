Argh, I actually noticed this issue while working on the page stat
simplification and thought I could break out a more isolated fix.  But
you are right, that won't be enough, and I can't possibly put a RCU
grace period in mem_cgroup_migration().

I also just realized that we can't remove the PageCgroupUsed() check
when updating the page stat, either, because the "fast path" start of
the transaction does not verify the memcg for us - we can't tell
whether it's gone stale before or during the transaction.  Grrr.

Andrew, please scratch this patch and the next 4-part series that
reworks the page stat updates.  I'll send a reduced version of it
that's marked for 3.17-stable.

Thanks
