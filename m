[So, some futex recent discussions remind me I should make this request]

Hello all (especially those in the To:, namely Thomas, Darren, Ingo, Jakub),

The futex man pages:
http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/futex.2.html
http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/futex.7.html
are currently in a sorry state. I'm by no means convinced that all of the
futex operations described there are explained fully and correctly. And 
probably not all error cases for each operation are properly documented.
I'd be very happy if some folk could review those pages and send me 
corrections (Git: http://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/docs/man-pages/man-pages). 

But worse, a number of futex operations remain undocumented in futex(2)
(see the list below).

I am aware of Documentation/pi-futex.txt and 
Documentation/futex-requeue-pi.txt. However, both of those documents
are rather thin on details / explain what certain FUTEX_* operations are
used for rather than what they do / focus on the implementation, rather 
than the semantics.

What I would like is that the futex(2) page documenta each one of 
these operations with a focus on the semantics in a way that might be
useful to writers of library functions or those who simply wish to
better understand (from a user-space perspective) what futexes are 
and how they are used. However, I don't have the knowledge to do 
this well in any reasonable time. 

Would the folk in the To: list (or anyone else who is knowledgeable) 
be willing to write patches
(Git: http://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/docs/man-pages/man-pages )
or just supply me with some raw text that documents these currently
undocumented futex operations, in the manner suggested?

The operations for which documentation is currently missing are:
