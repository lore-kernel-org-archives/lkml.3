Sure, see https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=68661 . Please
feel free to edit the bug's title, etc, as you see fit.

I see. 32-bit x86 seems to be dropping in relevance quite fast.

On the other hand, this is one of the last warnings I see when currently
building x86 (32-bit, that is) and it would be rather nice to see this
warning gone. Since my .config is basically a Fedora 20 .config, that
would help make Fedora's 32-bit x86 build (almost) warning free too.
