Yup, you are.

Right. Where does that end up? All the way down in
ext4_mark_iloc_dirty(), and that does:

        if (IS_I_VERSION(inode))
		inode_inc_iversion(inode);

The XFS transaction code is the same - deep inside it where an inode
is marked as dirty in the transaction, it bumps the same counter and
adds it to the transaction.

If a filesystem is providing an i_version value, then NFS uses it to
determine whether client side caches are still consistent with the
server state. If the filesystem does not provide an i_version, then
NFS falls back to checking c/mtime for changes. If files on the
server are being modified without either the tiemstamps or i_version
changing, then it's likely that there will be problems with client
side cache consistency....

Right, there's no unconditional need for a transaction except if the
filesystem is providing the inode version change feature for NFS.
ext4, btrfs and XFS all do this unconditionally, and so therefore
those filesystem have a need for an inode change transaction on
every page fault, just like they do for every write(2) call.

Cheers,

Dave.
