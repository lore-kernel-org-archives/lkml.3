offset is usual in bytes.

Lets imagine that we have a file, which contains siginfo-s.
If "pos" is offset in bytes, the same code can reads siginfo-s from the
file and from signalfd.

Only for the first question.

It's true, if both SFD_QUEUE flags was specified.
If only one for these flags is specified, the 'offset' argument is a
sequnce number in a proper list.

No. crtools reads signals from each queue separately.

Looks reasonable.
