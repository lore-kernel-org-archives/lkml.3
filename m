First, Thanks for your advice and help.

We are also not sure how many extents to move in 1 transaction.
xfs_bunmapi deletes 3 extents in 1 iteration.
But deletion and updation are 2 different tasks.
BTW, we tested this patch with 10,000 extents and it is working fine.
Could you help us out here? What number would be appropriate?

Your concern is correct.
There can be 2 approach of updating the extent tree.

Approach1: (The way truncate works): We start from the last allocated
extent and move towards the last offset which was punched out.
It mean start updating extents from right side and move towards left
and update btree in between
Approach2: We start from the extent just after the punched area and
move towards the last extent of the file.
It means moving from left to right and update btree in between.
When we used approach 1, we were getting btree corruption but there
seems to be no problem in approach2.
And, that holds true even in the case where 2 extents have _exactly_
same starting offset and length.
So, in approach2, attempt to shift extent that overlaps an existing
extent is working correctly without requiring any extent split.
we will check the reason for it.

It already is going through xfs_change_file_space(). Check this=>

we are using xfs_change_file_space(). See my comment above. :)
But, xfs_change_file_space does not change logical file size.
Neither can we use xfs_setattr, because it will truncate the
preallocated extents beyond EOF.

xfs_free_file_space does that for us.
