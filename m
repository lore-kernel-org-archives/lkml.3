Yes, attribute deletions are blocked till the on-going sysfs
read/write operations are finished and further rw accesses are failed.

I'm not really following what the actual problem case is, so SCSI
subsystem store methods are derefing dev->driver without synchronizing
against detach events?  If that's the case, the solution would be
synchronizing against attach/detach events?  Sorry if I'm being
totally idiotic.  I'm having a bit of hard time jumping right in.  :)

Thanks.
