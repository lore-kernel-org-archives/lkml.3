Yes, that's what reading data from disk requires.

Ugh. No. This is Simply Wrong.

We handle the memory allocations in the IO path with
GFP_NOFS/KM_NOFS where necessary.

We also do this when setting up regular file inodes in
xfs_setup_inode():

        /*
         * Ensure all page cache allocations are done from GFP_NOFS context to
         * prevent direct reclaim recursion back into the filesystem and blowing
         * stacks or deadlocking.
         */
        gfp_mask = mapping_gfp_mask(inode->i_mapping);
        mapping_set_gfp_mask(inode->i_mapping, (gfp_mask & ~(__GFP_FS)));

Which handles all of the mapping allocations that occur within the
page cache read/write paths.

Remember, you removed the KM_NOFS code from the XFS allocator that
caused it to clear __GFP_FS in an earlier patch - the read Io path
is one of the things you broke by doing that....

If there are places where we don't use GFP_NOFS context allocations
that we should, then we need to fix them individually....

Cheers,

Dave.
