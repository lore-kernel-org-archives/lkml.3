I don't have a particular affinity for either approach.

I think from a safety POV, it's less error prone to spawn the UMH
programs as a descendent of the userland process that originally
started up nfsd. That way we ensure that it inherits all of the
limitations of the original task.

If we try instead to start with a process that is running with all
capabilities and then drop some of them selectively, then it seems
quite possible to miss something.

But...namespaces aren't really my "thing", and I might have the
terminology wrong or be missing some other crux of the issue.
