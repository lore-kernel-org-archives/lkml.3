Some possible solutions:

1) The first time TCMU sees an opcode it passes it up and notes whether 
it is handled or not. If it was handled then future cmds with that 
opcode are passed up but not retried in the kernel. If it was not 
handled then it and all future commands with that opcode are handled by 
the kernel and not passed up.

2) Same as #1 but TCMU operates on SCSI spec granularity - e.g. handling 
any SSC opcode means userspace must handle all SSC commands.

3) Like #2 but define opcode groupings that must all be implemented 
together, independent of the specifications.

4) Have passthrough mode set at creation, but with more than two modes, 
either grouped by SCSI spec or our own groupings.

5) Never pass up certain opcodes, like the ALUA ones or whatever.


Have a good weekend -- Andy
