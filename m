In that case, I'll take a stab at nuking rw. I'm almost certain that
some of these are completely wrong (for example, of the form
if (rw == WRITE) do_write(); else do_read();). This isn't an immediate
problem for swap files on BTRFS, as __blockdev_direct_IO does a bitwise
test, so I think I'll split it out into its own series.
