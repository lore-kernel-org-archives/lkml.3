(I suggest that some text about this text go into the kdbus(7) page.)

That's at https://code.google.com/p/d-bus/ , right? This looks like a 
good direction to go in. Thanks for tackling that.

I hope to take a longer look sometime soon, but a few general conventions
for man-pages that you might want to consider following:

* When listing errors, I think you should change your 
  language/formatting somewhat. Examples here from kdbus.endpoint.7:
   
  (1) The man page says

          RETURN VALUE
               On success, all mentioned ioctl commands return 0.

       Better to write this from a user-space point of view:

          RETURN VALUE
               On success, all mentioned ioctl commands return 0; on 
               error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate 
               the error.

  (2) I would change the wording in the ERRORS sections from
       "may return the following errors"
       to
       "may fail with the following errors"

  (3) When listing the errors, drop the minus signs; that's not 
      what user-space sees. They see a positive value in errno.

  (4) The usual formatting convention for constants, including 
      error constants in man pages is boldface, rather than 
      underline/emphasis.

  (5) Insofar as it's possible, it would be good to make all
      pages format nicely within 80 columns. Some of the literal
      text and ASCII art could, I think, be narrowed.

Thanks,

Michael
