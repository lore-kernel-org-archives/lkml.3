True ... I'm not really here-or-there on it.  I can put it back.

Yes and no.  Yes, I agree that panic_no_warn setting & panic() could race
leading to multiple threads hitting the function panic(),  but (see below)

panic(), after disabling local interrupts does spin_trylock(&panic_lock) so
your multiple thread panic cannot occur.  The stack trace on the other threads
will still be intact (this is no different from other situations where
multiple threads have panicked).  So no, I don't see the situation you describe
where multiple threads hitting that panic() can cause a problem here.

spin_lock(&warn_lock) or something around the whole thing.  In any case it is a
really contrived situation so I'm not worried about it [unless someone has seen
it in a real world scenario].
