The long-standing, user-visible definition of the current line agrees
with me.  You can't just redefine this, period.

I tried to explain to you how insane the motivation for this patch is,
but it does not look like you are reading what I write.  But you don't
get to change user-visible behavior just like that anyway, much less
so without a sane reason, so this was a complete waste of time :-(
