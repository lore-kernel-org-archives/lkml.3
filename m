I think I sent a usable patch that Ted merged part of into e2fscktools;
the kernel portion was dropped for some reason.

While I was waiting to hear back on the kernel portion, I started
looking into the dtime stuff, but then I got distracted by a new job.

Assuming that I won't have time to deal with dtime (since it seems to be
much more complicated), is the right way forward for me to rebase the
non-dtime portion of my patch against the latest kernel, and resend it?
If so, will it get merged?  (Assume here that I do the same with the
e2fsck stuff)
