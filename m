If you could ptrace a process before it calls setuid and you can't
after it calls setuid, then this is stupid and doesn't matter -- once
you've pwned a process, you retain your pwnership at least until exec.

So yes, except that it's not just suid exec.  It's any exec that any
LSM would not do if no_new_privs were set.

Hmm.  So why don't we just do a revoke whenever an exec that changes
cred happens?  (This will have some false positives, like unsharing
userns, I think, but we probably don't care.)

Can you point us at that infrastructure?  My limited grepping skills
didn't spot it.

I'd really like a solution where there are no read or write
implementations in the entire kernel that check permissions.  Failing
that, just getting it for procfs would be nice.  (uid_map, etc will
probably need to be revoked on unshare for this to work.)
