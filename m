It could be both, actually, right?

I guess I can't see anything really wrong with it.

It ignores the (poorly documented) LOCK_MAND case, but maybe that's OK.

Would it make sense to return the lock type held instead, so you could
do one flock(fd, LOCK_TEST) instead of flock(fd, LOCK_TEST|LOCK_SH) and
flock(fd, LOCK_TEST|LOCK_EX) ?

It'd be nice if we could fix /proc/locks.  (You'd think I'd know better,
but I've certainly been confused before when /proc/locks told me a lock
was owned by a nonexistant PID.)  But as long as multiple PIDs can "own"
a flock and as long as there's no simple ID we can use to refer to a
given struct file, I don't see an easy solution.
