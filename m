True, comment updated.

>From mark_page_accessed, we only call activate_page() for !PageActive
and PageLRU. The PageLRU is key, if it's set, the pages *must* be on the
inactive list or they'd trigger BUG_ON(PageActive) checks within
vmscan.c. Am I missing your point?

If I remove the PageActive check in mark_page_accessed then pages that
are already on the active list will always get moved to the top of the
active list. If that page is frequently passed to mark_page_accessed(),
it will both potentially increase the lifetime of the page and the
amount of LRU churn. This would be very unexpected.

Good question. The key here is that __lru_cache_activate_page only
searches the pagevec for the local CPU. If the current CPU is draining the
to_add_to_lru pagevec, it cannot also be simultaneously setting PageActive
in mark_page_accessed. It was discussed in the changelog here.

"Note that only pages on the local pagevec are considered on purpose. A
!PageLRU page could be in the process of being released, reclaimed,
migrated or on a remote pagevec that is currently being drained. Marking
it PageActive is vunerable to races where PageLRU and Active bits are
checked at the wrong time."

Subtle comments on the code belong in the changelog, right?

I don't think it can happen. If I'm wrong, PageActive checks in vmscan.c
will trigger.

How about putting this fix on top?
