This does not appear to be true.

Let me try again, with emphasis in the right place.

I think that *code running in a namespace* has no business even
knowing a unique identity of *that namespace* from the perspective of
the host.

In your example, if there's a veth device between netns A and netns B,
then code *in netns A* has no business knowing the identity of its
veth peer if its peer (B) is a sibling or ancestor.  It also IMO has
no business knowing the identity of its own netns (A) other than as
"my netns".

If A and B are siblings, then their parent needs to know where that
veth device goes, but I think this is already the case to a sufficient
extent today.

I feel like this discussion is falling into a common trap of new API
discussions.  Can one of you who wants this API please articulate,
with a reasonably precise example, what it is that you want to do, why
you can't easily do it already, and how this API helps?  I currently
understand how the API creates problems, but I don't understand how it
solves any problems, and I will NAK it (and I suspect that Eric will,
too, which is pretty much fatal) unless that changes.

Thanks,
Andy
