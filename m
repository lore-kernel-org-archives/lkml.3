No, this is not like soft_limit. Any external pressure (e.g. coming from
some of the parents) will exclude memcgs which are below its low_limit.
If there is no way to proceed because all groups in the currently
reclaimed hierarchy are below its low limit then it will ignore the low
limit. So this is an optimistic working set protection.

No, we will start with the direct reclaim as we do for the hard limit.
The only change wrt. hard limit is that we do not trigger OOM if the
reclaim fails.

It will get vmpressure notifications though and can help to release
excessive buffers which were allocated optimistically.

yeah, I do not think adding more to memcg is a good idea. I am still not
sure whether working around bad design decisions in applications is a
good rationale for a new controller.
