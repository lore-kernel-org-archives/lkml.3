Yes.  ;)

Having two 16-bit fields for data out / data in protection count in the
command header should be fine.

So that said, adding a new virtio_scsi_cmd_req_pi definition per your
recommendation, and will update the series to use this when the
VIRTIO_SCSI_F_T10_PI feature bit has been negotiated on both ends.

Mmm, at least for PI I don't think a residual field is necessary.

Any time the metadata is not fully read on outgoing WRITEs, or written
on incoming READs the next hop performing a VERIFY operation will end up
failing with a GUARD or REFERENCE TAG failure.

MKP..?

Nope, no particular reason for this.

No objection here.  Updating the patch series to place protection
information ahead of the actual data payload.
