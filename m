I'm not sure I follow this.

If CC is unset, you get only the CROSS_COMPILE prefix.
If CC is set to e.g. 'gcc', then you get a nicely formatted toolchain string.
But if CC already has the prefix applied, then this will result in
  having it duplicated, which surely won't work correctly.

In the long run, I would hope that a higher level Makefile or environment setting
will be setting the toolchain string appropriately (as well as handling build flags)
which is why I wanted to use an ifndef (which Thomas correctly pointed out is just
wrong).

Actually, after getting this tiny program accepted, my next task was working on a
proper fix for handling cross compilation in a more generic (not case-by-case) way.

CROSS_COMPILE prefix usage looks a bit uncoordinated in the tools directory, but most
tests seem to be favoring $(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc.

 $ cd tools ; mgrep CROSS
./vm/Makefile:CC = $(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc

./testing/selftests/size/Makefile:	CC = $(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc
./testing/selftests/powerpc/Makefile:CC := $(CROSS_COMPILE)$(CC)
./hv/Makefile:CC = $(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc
./perf/config/feature-checks/Makefile:CC := $(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc -MD
./perf/config/feature-checks/Makefile:PKG_CONFIG := $(CROSS_COMPILE)pkg-config

./power/acpi/Makefile:CROSS = #/usr/i386-linux-uclibc/usr/bin/i386-uclibc-
./power/acpi/Makefile:CC = $(CROSS)gcc
./power/acpi/Makefile:LD = $(CROSS)gcc
./power/acpi/Makefile:STRIP = $(CROSS)strip
./power/cpupower/Makefile:CROSS = #/usr/i386-linux-uclibc/usr/bin/i386-uclibc-
./power/cpupower/Makefile:CC = $(CROSS)gcc
./power/cpupower/Makefile:LD = $(CROSS)gcc

./power/cpupower/Makefile:export CROSS CC AR STRIP RANLIB CFLAGS LDFLAGS LIB_OBJS
./power/x86/turbostat/Makefile:CC		= $(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc

I agree it's desirable not to hardcode gcc, but we seem to be doing it all over
the place already.
