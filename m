The PCI Express specification allows devices to choose what types of accesses they support to the 
IO or memory address spaces provided by their BARs:

Excerpt from PCI Express Base Specification 3.0 page 109:
" When a device's programming model restricts (vs. what is otherwise permitted in PCI Express) the
characteristics of a Request, that device is permitted to "Completer Abort" any Requests which
violate the programming model. Examples include unaligned or wrong-size access to a register
block and unsupported size of request to a Memory Space.

Generally, devices are able to assume a restricted programming model when all communication will
be between the device's driver software and the device itself. Devices which may be accessed
directly by operating system software or by applications which may not comprehend the restricted
programming model of the device (typically devices which implement legacy capabilities) should be
designed to support all types of Requests which are possible in the existing usage model for the
device. If this is not done, the device may fail to operate with existing software."

How the system handles errors like Completer Aborts will vary - NMIs, hangs, or even processing 
bogus data are all possible.

There are some baseline rules on configuration space accesses (so generic PCI topology software
can work with all PCI cards), but not IO and memory space.  It's prudent to not generate IO
or memory accesses you don't know are supposed to work.
