Something like this.

Subject: [PATCH] userns: introduce new mount option MS_LOCK

After commit 5ff9d8a65ce80efb509ce4e8051394e9ed2cd942
vfs: Lock in place mounts from more privileged users,
in userns, the mounts of child mntns which copied from
parent mntns is locked and user has no rights to umount/move
them, it's too strict.

The core purpose of above commit is trying to prevent
unprivileged user from accessing files hidden by mount.
This patch introduces a new mount option MS_LOCK, this
gives user the capable to mount filesystem as the type
of lock if he wants to use mount to hide something.

And this patch also makes it possible to resolve the
problem brought by commit e51db73532955dc5eaba4235e62b74b460709d5b,
the i_nlink is incorrect in some filesystems.
