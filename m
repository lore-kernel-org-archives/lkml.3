It's possible that I've misunderstood your patches, but I really don't
see where you're calling into LSMs to give them a chance to veto
access by *f_cred*.

No.  This just means that, if there's a possibility that the caps are
wrong, you invoke ptrace_allow_access, which *does not re-check
capabilities*.
