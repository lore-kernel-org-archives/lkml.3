Hmm here you mean DMA, right?

Ok so I don't see those DMA messages and system starts just fine. I'm
thinking perhaps something broke after the IO mmu stuff in commit 
3f583bc21977a608908b83d03ee2250426a5695c... could this be indirectly
causing the CPU stalls and just blame hpsa in the path as a side effect?

/me goes out to try the commit.
