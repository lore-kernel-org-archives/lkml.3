I'll need to compare the logic used for that against what's in
head_64.S for setting up the initial tables. And mapping the kernel
chunk as not 1-to-1, etc.

In the meantime, I'll send a v4 series with the other identified
changes since everything else (up to the 64-bit phy/virt detachment)
seems to be working.
