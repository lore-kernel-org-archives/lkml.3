Umm...  I would be very surprised if it turned out to be a problem.
nfsd really doesn't give a fuck about its cwd and root - not in the
thread side of things.  And (un)exporting is (a) not on a hot path
and (b) not done from a kernel thread anyway.  fh_to_dentry and friends
doesn't care about root/cwd, etc.

I don't see anything that could cause that kind of issues.
