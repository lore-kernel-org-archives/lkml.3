  OK, makes sense. But then if there's heavy IO going on, anything that has
IO pending on it is pinned and IO completion can easily take something
close to a second or more. So meeting subsecond deadlines may be tough even
for ordinary data pages under heavy load, even more so for metadata where
there are further constraints. OTOH phones aren't usually IO bound so in
practice it needn't be so bad ;). So if it is sub-second unless someone
loads the storage, then that sounds doable even for metadata. But we'll
need to attach ->migratepage callback to blkdev pages and at least in ext4
case teach it how to move pages tracked by the journal.

  Yeah, but in such usecases the guarantees we can offer for completion of
migration are even more vague :(.
