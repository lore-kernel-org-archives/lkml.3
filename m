There's only one problem - patch 1 needs to come _after_ patch 2 to avoid
breaking git bisect.  Plus these patches 2 and 4 extend the fscache API
without adjusting the documentation - but that can be added later.

And I think Milosz deserves a beer (or other poison of his choice;-) for
finding a longstanding irritating bug.

I think AFS, CIFS, NFS and 9P all need patching too, but I can attend to that.

Should I take the patches through my tree?  Then I can make the adjustments.
