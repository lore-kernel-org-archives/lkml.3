Performance of scsi-mq-v2 looks even better than that of scsi-mq-v1. The
slight single-LUN regression is gone, peak IOPS with use_blk_mq=Y on my
test setup is now 3x the performance of use_blk_mq=N and latency has
been reduced further. I think this means reducing the number of context
switches did really help :-) Detailed measurement results can be found
on https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1YQOreL3_FxWmZfbl8xSzRfdGM/.

If you want you may add to the scsi-mq-v2 patch series:
