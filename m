Yeah, it's ugly, but I don't see a real alternative. We could try to
use RCU for this, but that slows down the list manipulation at the cost
of optimizing a rarely read procfile.

Now that I look though...it occurs to me that we have a problem here
anyway. Only blocked POSIX requests go onto that list currently, so
this misses seeing any blocked flock requests.

The only real solution I can think of is to put flock locks into the
blocked_list/blocked_hash too, or maybe giving them a simple hlist to
sit on.

I'll fix that up in the next iteration. It'll probably make flock()
tests run slower, but such is the cost of preserving this procfile...
