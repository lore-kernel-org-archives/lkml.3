No, it is still needed.  With the q->dev check added, q->nr_pending 
will always be 0 before blk_pm_runtime_init is called.  But if I/O is 
taking place then the number of pending requests really isn't 0.

Either you have to make sure the q->nr_pending is always correct, even 
when runtime PM isn't being used, or else the caller has to make sure 
that no I/O takes place before blk_pm_runtime_init is called.

Sorry, yes, you are right.  In fact, the caller has to make sure that 
runtime PM is enabled before calling blk_pm_runtime_init; otherwise the 
autosuspend timer might not work right.
