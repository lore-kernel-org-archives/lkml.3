By the way, I reshuffled my branches recently so the one you pull has
incoming patches that I think are mature enough to be worth testing but
haven't finished review yet.

That was partly Jeff's request, as he wanted his patches to get some
exposure while waiting for review.

It also means I can fold in some minor fixes instead of piling up fixes
for nits found by the kbuild robot.  (But maybe that unfairly denies it
some credit, I don't know.)

Anyway that means that branch is getting rewritten, say, weekly, as
opposed to never (or maybe for once-in-a-year level screwups).

Am I doing it wrong?
