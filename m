Before going into the details, I have a structural request: could you 
please further increase the granularity of the patch-set?

In particular I'd suggest introducing a helper Kconfig bool that makes the 
IDT readonly - instead of using CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE for that. 
CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE can then select this helper Kconfig switch.

Users could also select a readonly-IDT - even if they don't want a 
randomized kernel.

With that done, it would be nice to implement the read-only IDT changes in 
a separate, preparatory patch. If it causes any problems it will be easier 
to isolate.

Thanks,

	Ingo
