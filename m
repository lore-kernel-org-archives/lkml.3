It's not just unimplemented commands. Exposing any new command exposes
its borderline problems together with it.

Yes and that's why the whitelist is generally frowned upon. It's
inherently fragile. These devices simply aren't designed and
implemented to be exposed to lesser security domains directly. It's
true that it's already kinda broken that way but as I wrote before
it's a vicious cycle and we don't wanna keep building on top of it.
This expansion is gonna increase the usage of whitelisting which will
in turn attract further use cases which are likely to call for even
more expansion.

If the bulk of filtering can be solved with userland whitelisting as a
confined user, it should be possible to resolve peripheral problems
like log messages in simpler way, no? Can you please elaborate on the
log message problem? Who's spewing those messages?
