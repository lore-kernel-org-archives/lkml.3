Actually my initial report (14.67Mb/sec  3755.41 Requests/sec) was about ext4
However I have tried XFS as well. It was a bit slower than ext4 on all
occasions.
On the same machine results for XFS were:

    13.97Mb/sec  3576..27 Requests/sec

/dev/mapper/mpathc on /mnt/xfs type xfs (rw,noatime,nodiratime,nobarrier)
