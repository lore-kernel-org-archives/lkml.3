What type of logs? I have all.

Memory usage graph:
http://www.watchdog.sk/lkml/memory2.png

New kernel was booted about 1:15. Data in memcg-bug-4.tar.gz were taken about 2:35 and data in memcg-bug-5.tar.gz about 5:25. There was always lots of free memory. Higher memory consumption between 3:39 and 5:33 was caused by data backup and was completed few minutes before i restarted the server (this was just a coincidence).

It's all from the same cgroup but from different time.

The cgroup has limit 330M (346030080 bytes). As i said, these two processes were stucked and was impossible to kill them. They were, maybe, the processes which i was trying to 'strace' before - 'strace' was freezed as always when the cgroup has this problem and i killed it (i was just trying if it is the original cgroup problem).
