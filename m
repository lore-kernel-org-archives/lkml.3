It's not that I don't like you, I procmail it to a different folder
because of mobile phones: my inbox is about 50 deep and a stable patch
run can basically empty the cache ... this can be damn annoying if your
hotel reservation is number 51.

You don't need a different address, just use a different tag.  I tag all
SCSI git email with 

X-Git-Tree: SCSI

Ben Hutchings tags all his stable email with:

X-mailer: LinuxStableQueue (scripts by bwh)

and so on ... any header tag does ... I'm sure git-send-email can be
persuaded to add a more meaningful one.

OK, adding it to the testing queue now.
