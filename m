Oh sure, I'm just more worried about leaking invalid memcgs rather
than temporarily skipping over a fully initialized one.  But I updated
the changelog to mention both possibilities.

That makes sense, updated.

So as far as I understand memory-barriers.txt we do not even need a
data dependency here to use store_release and load_acquire:

mem_cgroup_css_online():
<initialize memcg>
smp_store_release(&memcg->initialized, 1);

mem_cgroup_iter():
<look up maybe-initialized memcg>
if (smp_load_acquire(&memcg->initialized))
  return memcg;

So while I doubt that the smp_rmb() will become a problem in this
path, it would be neat to annotate the state flag around which we
synchronize like this, rather than have an anonymous barrier.

Peter, would you know if this is correct, or whether these primitives
actually do require a data dependency?

Thanks!

Updated patch:

Subject: [patch] mm: memcontrol: do not iterate uninitialized memcgs

The cgroup iterators yield css objects that have not yet gone through
css_online(), but they are not complete memcgs at this point and so
the memcg iterators should not return them.  d8ad30559715 ("mm/memcg:
iteration skip memcgs not yet fully initialized") set out to implement
exactly this, but it uses CSS_ONLINE, a cgroup-internal flag that does
not meet the ordering requirements for memcg, and so the iterator may
skip over initialized groups, or return partially initialized memcgs.

The cgroup core can not reasonably provide a clear answer on whether
the object around the css has been fully initialized, as that depends
on controller-specific locking and lifetime rules.  Thus, introduce a
memcg-specific flag that is set after the memcg has been initialized
in css_online(), and read before mem_cgroup_iter() callers access the
memcg members.
